Not directly but being vaccinated reduces your chances of getting infected and if you aren't infected you can't spread it.

No matter how strong your immune system is it has never seen Covid-19 before. The vaccine gives it a head start.

And most importantly, the vaccine is less effective in those with weaker immune systems. Those with a strong immune system actually benefit more from it.",pffrnq,pffrnq,,1,covidvaccine

hb4kys5,1630456055.0,RandomUsername1119,"You have two general parts of your immune system: the innate and the adaptive part. The innate part consists of Natural Killer cells, Dendritic cells, etc. These are first line defenses that ultimately only recognize self from non-self, or your own cells from foreign cells/bacteria/virus etc. The innate immune system activates the adaptive immune system which consists of T Cells, B cells, etc. This a more specific defense towards to invader. Once the foreign target is identified then your B cells produce antibodies that will, over time, become more and more specific towards that invader ,and direct T-cells and other immune cells to go after it. The time from first exposure to production of the full adaptive response can take up to 2-3 weeks.  In this time it spreads to and damages other tissues, causes convalescence, spreads to other people etc. 

However, some viruses and bacteria have ways to dodge parts of that pathway to avoid detection or prevent activation of immune response. COVID probably does this in several ways that we are still figuring out (syncytial cell spread). 

The vaccine allows your body to see the foreign invader in a non-infectious way to prime the immune response. That way, in the future if you run into that invader again, it takes less time to active the entire immune system.

Even if you THINK you have a great immune system, not a single human being has seen COVID 19 before 2019. No one has any natural immunity to it, prior to infection. How this virus reacts to your physiology and chemistry is unknown and you should not think that, just because you're young and healthy, you will be fine.",pffrnq,pffrnq,,1,covidvaccine

hb53wmo,1630464929.0,Mrsricksanchez,"Imagine Covid is a murderer who’s prowling your neighborhood and your immune system is you, in your house, wanting to protect yourself from aany murderers who might be out there. The Covid vaccine is like a photograph of this particular murderer. And maybe fingerprints, and other biometric data, that allows you to instantly identify this guy as a murderer. Now you have a choice when dealing with this murderer. You can have all that information and know for sure instantly who he is, and thus be able to respond to seeing him creeping around your house and peeping in your windows appropriately,  
Or
You can choose not to have that information and have to try and determine who this person is on your own by looking at him and watching him and asking him questions. You’re good at protecting yourself (you have a good immune system) so you’ll probably figure it out eventually, hopefully in time to keep him from murdering YOU, but why would you refuse info that would make that job easier and faster to accomplish and make it much less likely this murderer is going to have a chance of killing you before you react?

The vaccine teaches your immune system what the covid virus looks like and acts like and that the virus is a murderer. It informs your immune system so that your system will immediately identify and deal with this murderer if it ever sees it. There will be no time wasted and no chance for covid to attack first because your immune system was wasting time trying to figure out what covid was up to.  The vaccine is just information that alerts your immune system to this particular bad guy/threat, and makes even a good immune system, better. It makes it more informed and allows it to respond faster.",pffrnq,pffrnq,,1,covidvaccine
hbo4sdn,1630834819.0,Wrong-Trainer-3574,From my 2years of research I have found due to strong immune system you will be more likely to suffer side effects due to the huge response your body has to fight it. You know the “storm”. If you have weak immune system your body won’t fight as hard but either way the first shot lowers your immune system by 15% and second by 35%,pffrnq,pffrnq,,1,covidvaccine
hbrzqq5,1630906509.0,esther-21,"You are correct. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can become infected and then infect others. The difference is that unvaccinated people are more likely to become sicker especially from the variants. If they have an effective immune response, they may be asymptomatic. It is less likely to infect others if you are asymptomatic but there is a risk nevertheless, because virus particles are very small and are airborne, and while they are often carried by droplets, they can also be carried in the air independent of droplets, for example when a person is speaking. 
There is no way to stop the spread of covid or the mutation to new variants, even if 100% of the population were vaccinated, because vaccinated people still get infected and mutations still occur while they are host to the virus. Some studies suggest they may even promote more virulent mutations to occur. Furthermore, there are known animal vectors, such as cats, dogs and mink. There are likely many more. This is part of the reason shutdowns, passports and vaccine mandates will not work. They may flatten the curve, and that is good for the healthcare system, but unless the mutations become less virulent we will continue dealing with this issue.
Being unvaccinated is only a problem if a person has not been previously infected (prior infection gives more protection from the virus than even a vaccinated person would have), and if they are not taking precautions to prevent being infected by the delta variant or other voc. Also greater risk for people with underlying health issues, almost without fail.",pffrnq,pffrnq,,1,covidvaccine

That is no one else's decision but yours, because you have to live in your body for however many more years. I'm going to mention the pros and cons for the vaccine. 

The pros:
It is 95% effective in preventing YOU from being infected with COVID, provided your vaccines are current. 

The antibodies it helps develop will lessen the likelihood of you needing a respirator,  if you were to become infected with COVID and become hospitalized. 

Herd immunity is a real thing, and the less opportunity COVID has to spread from person to person, and infect them, the slower it may mutate. 

Masks are only so effective. 

Our hospitals in the US were not prepared/staffed for the pandemic, and cannot hold up against the demand as well. Wait times have been extended for anyone needing admission to the hospital. 

COVID is a nasty flu. In my honest opinion, im pretty sure it is a weaponized flu. It is also being considered a global killer amongst certain communities. While it's catch and kill rate are relatively low, over the years this goes on, it will likely exceed the Spanish influenza body count. 

Cons: 
You can still get COVID even though you are vaccinated. About 50% of people receiving the regeneron treatments (an infusion that is supposed to help keep you out of the hospital) are vaccinated. 

Viruses mutate. This is why we have not gotten rid of the regular flu. The common cold, etc. COVID will continue to mutate, and it is mutating pretty quick. Which means you'll need to get boosters as well, at least once, if not twice a year. 

There is still much we do not know about the long term effects from the shot because of how new it is. 

We have proven, and dangerous side effects being reported. 

Even if you are vaccinated, you can still infect others with COVID through touch or if you do happen to become infected. 

Due to the high demand for the vaccine, the drug companies are having to produce vaccines at an alarming rate. Operationally,  this is a concern for quality control. This means that there are more potential risks for tainted vaccines to go out.",pf5dhn,pf5dhn,Alarming-Afternoon-8,1,covidvaccine

You say you social distance, but how can we believe you when you won't get the best protection against the virus?

In Louisiana, a [younger than 1 year old has died from COVID](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wdsu.com/amp/article/louisiana-baby-dies-covid-19-delta-variant/37397143). Their death could have been prevented by people around them getting vaccinated. 

Yes. People die from getting the vaccine, and people die who are vaccinated against COVID. The same shit happens with the flu vaccine. 

HOWEVER. The flu doesn't create long lasting complications, like many have stated up thread. 

The reason people are arguing is because *we are tired*. We also want this pandemic to end, but in order for that to happen *every able bodied person needs to get vaccinated, wear a mask, and social distance*. Until then, we won't ever get back to normal, and people are going to continue losing loved ones due to the ignorance of those who won't get vaccinated. 

I try to have compassion for people, but the damn vaccine has been out for over half a year now and is *FDA approved*, and people are still being ignorant about the vaccine. 

If you don't get vaccinated, and you do end up sick from COVID, don't call 911 or go to the emergency room. Save that bed for someone who could actually use it, much like [this veteran ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-us-hospital-icu-bed-shortage-veteran-dies-treatable-illness/) who died due to lack of ICU beds available in Houston because they were full up of unvaccinated assclowns (to the tune of 85-97% unvaxxed).",pf5dhn,pf5dhn,Alarming-Afternoon-8,1,covidvaccine

I won't call 911 because I likely won't need the ICU, they odds are against that with or without the vaccine.

Getting mad at people is wrong, I'm starting to do it as I'm tired of people fighting over dumb shit these days.

The biggest kicker is that literally no one is forcing them to do either.  They just don't want the consequences of not wearing a seatbelt, regardless of whether it's a ticket or getting thrown through a windshield.

Apparently the risk of dying/being disabled from they lack of a  seatbelt is not an acceptable risk, but the risk of dying, being disabled AND potentially killing/disabling others IS acceptable with Covid.  And a safe, now FDA approved vaccine is an unacceptable form to mitigate it.

hbw5xj7,1630987957.0,Brittdi,"Hi! I relate to your post. So thank you for sharing your thoughts on here. 

I can confidently say that I have more vaccines than an average person due to travelling/living in a different country for my internship. This vaccine though, has put me on the uncomfortable side and I realize it’s because I am anti-mandate, not anti-vax. 

I should start by saying it’s awesome that medicine can develop, and I do believe smart people are working on the vaccine and would want to develop something that can do the population good, not harm. 

With that being said, here are some of the root causes of my disappointment for this covid-19 vaccine situation:

- hard working business owners are being forced to police/enforce this. This is not what they opened their business for. 
- the media is playing up the numerator of “cases” / negative outcomes of covid and not reminding people to also consider the denominator
- the divide that is being created between people
- the media/governments are mostly talking vaccine for protecting from illness and not even mentioning other alternatives (vit D, etc)
- long term impacts of the vaccine are not known. We know this. Let’s hear the media talk about this more and allow us to feel safe talking about it too, and any other doubts we may have. Remember **Critical thinking is good for everyone, and actually enables vaccine companies (and any other companies), to make a better product**

So yah, after regulating and unpacking my thoughts, I realized that my “vaccine conflicts” are actually “mandate conflicts”. 

Although I have worked in healthcare (neuroscience field) for a long time, I am not qualified to tell you my opinion for what you should do. Just commenting here to validate what you’re thinking! 

Take your time coming up with a decision. Once you have one, and are happy to stick with it, you’ll feel better.

hb71vxp,1630508942.0,SwissM1972,"Well I cam looking for information on the vaccine - because media in my country never talk about side effects.  They showed extreme cases of ""log covid"", then said ""up to 50% of young people develop a long covid"" - talk about misinformation !

Mostly for professional reasons, I did get vaccinated.  Ended up being Moderna.  I was sick for two weeks after the first shot: drained, joint pain, and some (more moderate) chest pain - which I didn't worry about because it was going away if I got up and walk...

Told all this to the nurse when I went for my second shot; I was in a university center, so they called-in a doctor who just said ""nah, this looks like nothing that the vaccine would cause"".  So they just encouraged me to go ahead and take my second shot, which I did.

I'm in my high forties, but sporty (swimming, hiking, weightlifting).  After my second shot I thought ok, I shall not let go of myself.  So in spite of symptoms appearing again, 6 days after my shot I went swimming in open waters... and after a few minutes had a violent paralyzing, chest pain. I barely managed to gasp for air, stay idle at the surface, relax ... and reach back for help.  It was the first time in my life I thought I might die !

Luckily, this wasn't a full blown heart attack, but apparently I'm a victim of the myocarditis/pericarditis that the vaccines can cause.  Three weeks after my 2nd shot I'm still under treatment for it, taking high-dose NSAIDs to moderate the pain (which was waking me up at night, chest pain irradiating into my left arm).  Things seem under control now, but my treatment is ongoing, and I'm not ready yet to resume exercising.

What makes me furious is that Moderna had issued (in Switzerland, my country), 4 days before my second jab, a warning letter asking that all vaccinated persons be informed that they must immediately consult a doctor in case of any chest pain.  And in other countries (Belgium, Singapore), authorities go further by advising the public that any intense physical activity must be avoided in the days that follow your jabs.

I informed my vaccination center, and got a kind of apologetic call from their medical director, but he still justified that each vaccinating nurse(is all personnel even that qualified?) is to decide which side effects are to be communicated to each individual. How does this constitute an ""informed consent"" !?!?

So yes, I'm a new account, but a real person, and a real victim of the vaccine - which for me was clearly much worse than COVID itself (I've been caring for parents who were confirmed cases and wanted to stay in their home during their sickness, pretty sure I caught it then, although I had mild or no symptoms at all).

Am I an exception, just bad luck?  I don't know, it doesn't seem like anyone cared to report me as someone who is suffering severe side effects.  Authorities don't seem to care !",pdzdkt,havgs9v,patti_la,2,covidvaccine

Please assume the best of them and their intentions. 
  
  
Next, it's great that you're reaching out to qualified medical experts about the vaccine. I'm surprised you have to wait so long for your appointment, though. Was there no earlier tele-health options? Alternatively, if you don't have a specific-to-you medical concern, but just general medical concerns, there's lots of online resources you could investigate. For instance, @jessicamalatyrivera (an infectious disease epidemiologist) and @kinggutterbaby (an infectious disease specialist who runs COVID medical trials at a hospital) both answer questions frequently on instagram, and have highlights where they've answered tons of questions with clear, easy to understand science. 
  
  
I hope you can have your questions answered soon, and feel comfortable getting vaccinated- especially now that Pfizer is fully FDA approved.

The new evidence shows that protective antibodies generated in response to an mRNA vaccine will target a broader range of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying “single letter” changes in a key portion of their spike protein compared to antibodies acquired from an infection.

I also struggle with health anxiety, but my fear of getting covid and the potential long-term ramifications of that motivated me to get vaccinated. I didn't have any hesitancy about getting a vaccine because by the time it rolled around to my neck of the woods (Japan), the vaccines had already seen widespread usage in other parts of the world. I figured if there were any major side-effects associated with the vaccines, that they would have popped up already. However, you're right, there are still a lot of unknowns and there have been cases of people reporting side-effects that aren't commonly associated with these vaccines. Buuuut, overall, it seems that the side-effects are largely predictable. I think a lot of the outlying cases need more investigation, but they do not represent the general experience when it comes to this vaccine. There have also been a number of sources saying that any long-term effects would appear within the first 2 months. We're well past that in the global rollout, but it doesn't seem like anything of note popped up within that timeframe.  
Also, it seems like the effects on fertility are merely [rumors](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html) at this time.

COVID isn't the only vaccine to require boosters! Tdap requires a booster every 10 years or so.

I'm in Ireland and received J&J by a pharmacist. They had a room set up in a different part of the shopping centre.

My appointment was at opening time. A group of pharmacists showed up for work one by one. I got there early and two were already inside. I didn't see any fridges, boxes etc. Just lots of chairs in one section for filling out consent forms/waiting area, then there were the vaccine booths for privacy and then the after-vaccine observation chairs.

I was first into the booth. She had a a bunch of envelopes in a box, one for each person and it had information. On the table she had a pen, fresh gloves and then a black bag hanging off the table. I didn't see a yellow sharps bin but then I wasn't really looking around. I was trying to stay calm as my brain overeacts to pain when I get needles, tattoos etc and I feel faint. On the table, she had a small tray with about 8 syringes on them prefilled with caps on them. When she went to inject me, she took off the cap and chucked that in the bin. No idea where the syringe/needle went.

I felt okay but about a minute into sitting in the observation chair, I had to go lay down on the bed that they had ready. I was about to faint but I didnt. I was so scared that it was an allergic reaction but it was just my brain doing its thing. Happens almost every time I get an injection, blood drawn or get tattoos. 

The vaccine was early morning. Felt alright all day, arm was a little sore but overall fine. Later in the night, the arm pain went away and I fell asleep. I woke up during the night feeling hot but cold. I think I only woke up because I had to pee though. I went to work but I told my manager I had to leave. I was achy all over, I was walking very slow, my arm hurt, I had a wrist pain in the opposite arm (stabbing, come and go). The worst thing was the 'pressure' in my eyes. They just felt like they were gonna pop out or something, just sore in general to look around. When I closed my eyes, my eyelids felt heavy. I rested in bed and had a two hour nap.

Your boyfriend may want to do some research on the potential that Covid may cause permanent impotence and/or erectile dysfunction in men who catch it, and also should note that the virus tends to hang out in the testicles and sperm after recovery from Covid.

>COVID-19 survivors might develop sexual and reproductive health issues. Andrological assessment and tailored treatments should be considered in the follow-up.

>Testicular damage in COVID-19 might, therefore, induce a state of hypogonadism as proven by decreased testosterone-to-LH ratio in patients with COVID-19, suggestive of impaired steroidogenesis resulting from subclinical testicular dysfunction. Post-mortem examinations of testicular tissue from 12 COVID-19 patients showed significantly reduced Leydig cells, as well as edema and inflammation in the interstitium.

Since the vaccine roll out they have been collecting data on CT values (i.e. viral load) from PCR tests and calculating the vaccine efficacy.

Viral loads are reduced for vaccinated persons compared to unvaccinated for the Delta variant, but not by much - the study records CT values of about 27 compared to 23 respectively, with uncertainties of about 2. The lower the CT value, the higher the viral load and thus the more infectious a person is. But this counts a positive case as CT < 37 which is high enough that it's basically asymptomatic. The gap between CT values narrows as you reduce this CT threshold. In short, vaccinated people are almost just as likely to transmit Delta variant than unvaccinated.

Also, this is a quote from the paper, 'Our estimate of vaccine effectiveness against all SARS-CoV-2 infections for two doses of
vaccine was 49% in the most recent data, increasing to 58% when we defined effectiveness
only for strong positives.' bear in mind the vast majority of infections looked at in this round were for the Delta variant - with the alpha effectiveness was much higher.

In summary, getting double jabbed is roughly 60% effective at reducing or stopping a symptomatic response to covid, which isnt amazing but it's not as bad as not having a vaccine at all. The vaccine is more likely to protect you from a symptomatic case than not (data from Israel would disagree, see next link). But it has [88% efficacy at reducing hospitalisations](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/07/23/delta-variant-pfizer-covid-vaccine-39percent-effective-in-israel-prevents-severe-illness.html).

RNA is degraded in the body.  Doesn't mean it's degraded outside of the body except by temperature.  Keep it cold enough and it's easy to put into a lipid.  Routinely done in the lab for everyday experiments.  See Lipofectamine 3000.

>How was the mrna developed? I know it was genetically engineered but how was the process done? What was it derived from?

RNA can be synthesized from scratch using an oligo synthesizer (generally for smaller RNAs) or can be generated from a template strand of DNA in a cell free system.  See in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA.

>All of the promotion of the vaccine mentions that the S-protein (spike protein) generated in the vax is harmless. How was this designed to be so?

It's locked in the prefusion state through a modification in the sequence.  It also doesn't hang around in the body long.

>How many Mrna's are encapsulated in the syringe?

About 25 pmols worth per Pfizer dose.

>How much S-protein is generated during the transcription process?

This is unknown as it's going to vary from person to person.  You don't need a lot to generate an immune response.  The immune response was empirically determined from various doses of vaccine in Phase 2.

>Assume the immune system isn't able to fight all of the S-proteins off, what happens then?

There's nothing to ""fight"" here.  The spike protein isn't alive.  Proteins degrade in a few days.

>Do they navigate to other parts of the body and cause potential harm? 

No.  These aren't live viruses.  

>Is the Mrna tech just designed to create the s-protein, nothing else?

The technology overall or just the vaccine?   The particular vaccine only generates spike.

>Since the immune system has cells that are designed to attack invaders instantly, is it possible for the Mrna mechanism to be destroyed this way

What I can tell you I I know many many people who have had the vaccine. Almost all of my family and work place and no one has had adverse effects. However some of them have had covid previously and the cases ranged from mild to hospitalization to long lasting effects that have not eased for 6mo+

I have done tons of research (not just talking to friends but actually looking up numbers and claims of side effects) and those stories are incredibly minimal compared to the very real effects covid can have on you if unvaccinated. 

Yes you may still get covid while vaccinated but the percentage of cases that result in long lasting effects of hospitalization are incredibly minimal compared to unvaccinated. 

The research on the vaccine began well before the large scale outbreak of the pandemic. And the numbers continue to confirm that it is effective and safe. 

All medicines and vaccines come with warnings and possible side effects. But in most cases the treatment they provide outweighs that and the side effects are outliers not the norm.

h8ji3i9,1628694198.0,Herbalist33,"I completely agree, and this is what a lot of people do not understand: there is no long term data on these vaccines. To even completely know if there’s an effect on fertility we’ll have to wait for the generation to be born post vaccine rollout to grow to reproductive age, so~18years, because often it is the second generation that are effected.

That being said, do you have a source for the animal studies, because as far as I was aware Pfizer didn’t even conduct reproductive studies before the rollout, so unless they have done it since, it’s news to me that there even were any studies.

Anyone who regurgitates the line that no corners were cut in the testing of this vaccine obviously haven't done their own research. 

In answer to OP, it’s seriously your choice to make, and you have to be comfortable with the choice you make. No one can make it for you, and I’m sure your family are coming from a place of love and caring for you, but in terms at knowing whether it’ll effect your fertility, no one knows yet. Personally I would say if you have other co-morbidities such as being overweight, diabetic, high blood pressure or low vitamin D levels, I would consider taking it, otherwise the risks are extremely small that you will die from covid.

OP, you should not even have to ask this- in the U.K. early on in the rollout it was found that anyone with a history of any serious allergic reactions (that required an epipen intervention) were at risk of having a serious reaction to the jab, and so were warned not to take it.

Now throw in the fact that you’re directly allergic to an ingredient that’s actually in the vaccine, and that is a no brainer! 

I can’t speak for the other vaccines, but would imagine the moderna one may also contain PEG, but not sure. You may be ok with the AstraZeneca, but I would recommend you do your own research into the ingredients of each vaccine to make sure there is definitely no PEG in them. Don’t rely on thinking that your doctor would necessarily know this.

From the CDC website : 

Who Should NOT Get Vaccinated
If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction, even if it was not severe, to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (such as polyethylene glycol), you should not get either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
If you had a severe or immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get a second dose of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
A severe allergic reaction is one that needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen or with medical care. Learn about common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and when to call a doctor.
An immediate allergic reaction means a reaction within 4 hours of exposure, including symptoms such as hives, swelling, or wheezing (respiratory distress).
If you aren’t able to get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you may still be able to get a different type of COVID-19 vaccine. Get more information for people with allergies.",p1xhor,p1xhor,victoria1204x,1,covidvaccine
h8yjz1a,1628977748.0,kaladit,"The key concern here is whether you have anaphylaxis to PEG.   Having hives is ok, you can still have the vaccine, but having anaphylaxis is not.

If in doubt, talk to your doctor and maybe see an allergy specialist before making the decision.",p1xhor,p1xhor,victoria1204x,1,covidvaccine
