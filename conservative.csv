hb5k7x4,1630474366.0,dont_tread_on_meeee,"> what are the numbers for re-infection with out vaccine compared to with vaccine?

I don't think numbers are known. But vaccinated people don't get ""reinfected"", and unvaccinated people haven't been been known to get the same variant twice (except some immunocompromised cases.)

> If you are vaccinated and wear a mask how are you affected by someone who chooses not to get vax or wear a mask since you're pretty well protected?

It's all about quantity of viral particles you're exposed to and how they enter you.

- Sneezes, coughs, yelling and singing project more droplets that carry the virus into the air. Breathing does less but still some.
- Some of those droplets being exhaled could be prevented by a mask, but the kind of mask matters greatly. Most masks are not designed to effectively stop such small droplets being exhaled.
- Depending on air circulation and other factors, the particles may disperse into low densities (e.g. outdoors), or concentrate over time in an enclosed area.
- Some of those droplets being inhaled could be prevented by a mask, but the kind of mask matters greatly. Most masks are not designed to effectively stop such small droplets being inhaled. N95s and KN95s are thought to be much more effective, whereas cotton masks are about as useless as a screen door on a submarine.
- Then depending on how many particles you inhale, over what period of time, and where they settle in your system could determine the initial viral load. Higher initial infections correlate with higher viral loads and more serious disease.
- Now if you're vaccinated, you body has a jumpstart on a coordinated immune response; if it has exactly the right antibodies in high enough quantities, it can very quickly suppress the infection to low levels. If you aren't vaccinated, it takes a while for your body to ""learn"" about the virus, and generate antibodies. This means more time for the virus to replicate in larger numbers.
-  The mRNA vaccines suppress the original variant low enough to prevent retransmission, but not Delta. Against Delta, your body is somewhat prepared but not enough to outright prevent infection. It still needs to ""learn"" and adapt,  which takes some time but not as long as without a vax.
- One must also consider a strong immune response can be as dangerous as the virus itself; inflammation caused by the immune system in response can do a lot of damage as the body overreacts. See cytokine storm.

Short of it is though, a person of any vax/mask can still infect another vaxxed/masked person. Vaxxed people generally don't shed as much virus on the transmission end, N95s help reduce inhalation of virus on the receiving end, and environmental factors between can disrupt (or aid) transmission by a huge degree. Lower viral counts = better outcomes.",pfem16,hb4u9iz,Montykea,2,conservative

hb566pg,1630466099.0,Nightsfaded,"A couple points you might consider. 

The amount of cars in the parking lot has very little correlation with how many ICU nurses are available to provide the level of care a patient needs to survive. 

The main reasons you see less cars in the parking lot are restrictions on visitors and less day services being provided.

 I do work with most of the major hospital groups in Central Florida. Not in a healthcare field but rather a facilities maintenance field. All of my large clients are not doing any elective surgeries at this time. That means if you aren't in imminent danger of dieing you are not going under the knife. This also means that there are thousands of fewer patients being admitted for short hospital stays across the area. 

One of the unspoken repercussions of this situation is people who would have normally received care and been put on a path to being healthier are instead being left to have their conditions worsen. Which  results in more demand for the already over extended ICU's. 

Personally I wouldn't consider hospitals that are unable to perform basic non-life threatening surgeries  ""functioning as needed"" 

Now say you need surgery because you do have a pressing possibly fatal if not immediately taken care of medical situation here in Central Florida. Well when your life saving surgery is going to be scheduled is going to be based upon ICU bed availability.

The healthcare system being overwhelmed has never been about how many people can fit in a building. It is about resources, properly trained staff, equipment, etc... 

Here's a personal anecdote. Recently supposed to start a job at a Tampa area hospital. Some of our guys show up Monday morning and are promptly turned away along with the rest of the contractors on site because the system that provides oxygen to the patients is running at 140% of its rated output.

Before Chicken Pox vaccine licensure in 1995 the fatality rate for varicella (Chicken Pox) was approximately 1 per 100,000 cases among children age 1 through 14 years, 6 per 100,000 cases among persons age 15 through 19 years. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html 

- 385 <18 have died from Covid in the US https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge
- <18 population size 74,000,000

Under a conservative estimation that only ~1/3 of persons under 18 have been exposed to covid19 (25,000,000) the Covid19 fatality rate for people under 18 is 385/25,000,000 = 1.54 per 100,000 cases among persons <18. 

- Estimated Covid fatality rate <18 = 1.54 per 100,000 cases
- Chicken Pox fatality rate 1-14 = 1 per 100,000 cases
- Chicken Pox fatality rate 15-19 = 6 per 100,000 cases

“Investigation of suppressed innovations, inventions, treatments, cures, and so on, rapidly reveals that the peer review system is arguably better at one thing above all others: censorship.”

“The systemic failure of peer review is one of science’s major, embarrassing open secrets”

“Peer review is known to engender bias, incompetence, excessive expense, ineffectiveness, and corruption. A surfeit of publications has documented the deficiencies of this system.” https://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2004/01/29/peer_review_politics_of_science.htm

“ Certain sorts of innovation are welcome in science, when they fall within established frameworks and do not threaten vested interests. But aside from this sort of routine innovation, science has many similarities to systems of dogma. Dissenters are not welcome. They are ignored, rejected, and sometimes attacked.“ BRIAN MARTIN, STRATEGIES FOR DISSENTING SCIENTISTS, JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION, VOL. 12, №4, 1998, PP. 605–616.

Significant scientific publications — for example, the journal Nature — have a well documented history of prejudice against findings or hypotheses that run contrary to established scientific dogma.

“Experts” are lionized because the world that made them experts promotes and validates them when they affirm the already established (and profitable) beliefs — and the media is complicit in this.

When he did, Holmes met him with a drawn handgun and shot him. The victim fled the store, fell outside, followed by the defendant [who], according to the surveillance video, shot a second time. The defendant then paces back and forth and shot a third time. 

1st shot maybe self defense, maybe. It's definitely not, but maybe you can run with that as a defense attorney. 2nd and 3rd shot after the victim fled the store, is definitely not. It's not self defense if the person you're shooting is fleeing. 
 
>Holmes, who defense attorney Jonathan Feldman said “has a big heart and is a kind-hearted man,” shot the man again, then paced around and shot him a third time before running away, according to Auguste. The victim, who was shot in the stomach, arm, and leg, was taken to a hospital where surgeons removed part of his intestines, Auguste said.  

*Holmes has a big heart and is a kind hearted man, shot the man again.* Merriam dictionary describes a big heart as someone who is kind and generous. Well two things here, merriam dictionary will now be required, by law, to change the definition at the discretion of the left wing party. But to be fair he *was* super generous, when he shared multiple bullets to his new friend. /s

>Chicago cops heard the gunfire and responded quickly enough to see Holmes running away, according to Auguste. He ditched his gun and security vest along the way and later told arresting officers where they could find them, Auguste said. Holmes also allegedly admitted to shooting the victim. 

You don't run away from a self defense situation, unless there's a threat of more violence or bodily harm towards you(see Rittenhouse), and you don't ditch your gun. That's a criminal way of thinking. How do you run away after shooting a man 3 times, while ditching your gun, and the police are coming? 

>“This is obviously going to be a self-defense case,” Friedman said after hearing the allegations. He called the circumstances “basically, a customer who’s unruly, who wants to put other lives at risk,” by not wearing a COVID mask.

I mean, I don't see how this isn't going to be justified. This man(a POC) in a very liberal dominate city, shot a white man(possibly a conservative, because he's anti mask)in cold blood with no remorse.

On top of this, his detractors are vilified, regardless of their credentials and data sets. If Fauci feels attacked, what about those that have pointed out the problems with his decisions and his lack of reliance on data (i.e. kids aren't at risk - statistically - and therefore masks make no sense in schools, unless we've decided we're going to use masks for flu season, which is more likely to kill children)?

So, Fauci has a cult-like following that doesn't actually look at the data, the real science behind the decisions he makes, nor does he or his organization put forth the data behind decisions, only making recommendations. Those that follow Fauci do so with no objective position, and point to those that ask for data as sub-human and scornful.

Fauci dug this pit and now gets to stand in it. It will become apparent in the future that the majority of his decisions were bad on lockdowns, mask mandates, etc. because the data will finally be viewed transparently, and those that have pointed out the issues with his policies will be vindicated.

1. He was willing to tell people to not do all kinds of things, but when he was asked about the protests/riots last year, he said that he didn't think it was his place to give an opinion on that even though he wasn't even asked for his opinion. He was simply asked whether those types of gatherings would cause spread as well. If he was truly an objective voice, he would have said that it would risk spread. Arguing otherwise would be wildly inconsistent.
2. He said that New York handled COVID correctly. That's total bullshit. Cuomo managed to botch just about every major decision, the most significant of which was his nursing home scandal, for which he tried to pass blame in every direction he could, which didn't work because we had the receipts.

haxpukw,1630335831.0,user_1729,"The opposition is generally to the societal segregation of vaccinated/unvaccinated for a virus with an incredibly high survival rate and generally well understood transmission. Scared and feeble people can stay home, or they can go buy actually effective respirator style masks. The vaccine is effective and widely available. There's no excuse to cower in fear anymore and no reason to mandate QR codes, vaccine passports, and requirements for the covid vax in order to do normal day to day tasks. ""2 weeks to flatten the curve"" was 18 months ago, and right now there's no end in sight with booster requirements and continued ineffective mask mandates, restrictions on business and gatherings, and now vaccine passports. Additionally, studies suggest natural immunity from defeating the virus is comparable if not better than vaccine resistance, yet no one accepts a positive antibody test as evidence of inoculation. The ONLY thing that counts is the vaccine, even if it's one of the shitty ones. Any discussion about potential prophylactics is silenced, discussion about natural immunity is silenced, any discussion about risk analysis is silenced, I could go on. This has stopped being about science and controlling a pandemic and turned into just control. 

Most people don't need to be coerced into taking vaccines for actual deadly and highly contagious viruses. I've traveled abroad and I'm in the military, I get ALL the friggin vaccines, because I don't want to get typhoid fever as someone who lives in a western country in the 21st century. Carrying around papers/apps with status of a vaccine for a virus I've already had and beat, where survival for all but the most feeble people is well over 99% is just about power and control.

Keep in mind George Floyd is a COVID death to the CDC, so how many of these deaths include comorbidities or other causes is not clear (but likely a significant percentage). The vast majority of deaths have been people over the age of 75. Life expectancy is 77 for males in the US. As a healthy male in my 30’s, I’m worried about COVID like I worry about dengue fever. It’s a statistical possibility that I could die from COVID (or dengue fever for that matter) but not one I’m worried about. I’ve made similar decisions regarding flu vaccines over the years without repercussion from employers or being prevented from going to restaurants or stores in certain areas of the country. Couple all of this with the fact that CDC studies from July of 2021 are showing that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are carrying around the same amount of viral load in their noses, meaning this virus is everywhere, we’re all spreading it around and actual infection rates are probably VASTLY underreported, it’s just simply not a concern to me. If it is for you, get the vaccine. 

Lastly, the suppression from the mainstream media and big tech of any questioning of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines is 100% terrifying and fundamentally contrary to the scientific method.

So this is 30 years before that mentality even started to go away.  These 600 guys were barely a step above slaves (sharecroppers were workers who didn't get paid in money but in portions of the harvest and even then were subjected to strict rules on selling).  So yes...it was pretty fucked up to think about NOW...but I could totally understand being able to justify that type of study in a world where your reality was that black people were socially and LEGALLY viewed as less-than.  It sucked and it sucks to think about...but it's not relevant to what we're talking about now.  

And then at the end with the MMR / Autism thing?  Hasn't that been debunked to death at this point?  She really doubled down with that and it felt like she was just playing to the crowd hoping some worried mothers would hear her dig up the old autism-as-a-side-effect hysteria.  The correlation vs causation has been shown.  Autism starts to become evident in kids right around the same time the MMR vaccine is given.  That's the correlation.  People have linked autism to MMR because they weren't paying attention to autism symptoms prior to that time in their kids' lives.",pegd3m,haxc8eu,Usual-Tap836,2,conservative

In the past few days Japan has come down real hard on which side of the coronavirus conversation they're on. They halted millions of vaccines because they did their own research and determined there was metal in the vaccines. A Japanese Nobel prize winning virologist has come out to say that covid is man-made and not natural; claiming that no other virus in history has successfully spread to contrasting climates because they are only able to survive in the climate in which they were created. A study came out yesterday (that is not yet peer reviewed), that claims vaccinated individuals are many times more contagious than those that are unvaccinated and that booster shots will always be required for those that are vaccinated.


Let's assume that it is true that covid-19 came from the Wuhan lab through gain of function research and was accidentally leaked through transmission of a virus to Wuhan lab researchers. Let us also assume that the Nobel prize winning scientists is not lying. If the virus is man-made and is now infecting people then the question is was it a bio accident or bio weapon. If they were working on a bioweapon perhaps the research was not complete and they were still working on the final form. I wonder if there is another lab somewhere where they are continuing to work on the final form of covid. 


If any of this is true then things are going to get a whole lot worse from here on out. I fear that the scale of this is too great for us to combat. The world governments are working together to silence dissent, heavily push propaganda, implement invasive measures and much more authoritarian-esque policies in order to protect the ""people over the person"".

The greater a population of the virus, the better the chances of a beneficial mutation.  Vaccines reduce those chances simply by lowering the population.  

Nutshell, it's like people with... I dunno...  12 fingers.  If there was a terrorist group (the vaccine) killing everybody with 10 fingers, the 12 fingered folks will simply survive & reproduce.  Luckily, it doesn't seem like any variants have spawned a legit '12 fingered' version yet.

Then you put your hands on it and smear it all over every shared surface. Let me tell you from experience kids touch their masks about every 2 nano seconds. They would spend every minute of their day washing their hands. That’s assuming they would actually wash their hands and do it correctly (hint, zero chance). And they put their fingers in their mouths constantly. Even adults would have a hard time of this. I know for a fact my kids school does zero to encourage the kids to wash their hands.

This is incorrect. It's a vaccine that is actually quite effective. The point is you are less likely to get covid, less likely to spread it and less likely to get seriously ill. It actually has quite minimal side effects that are of far less concern than the virus.

If enough people get vaccinated the virus will not be able to effectively spread in the population and any outbreaks that do happen to occur will not be as harmful. If even more get vaccinated worldwide we actually stand a chance of having it die out especially if we can improve the efficacy against variants.

hawm02i,1630311208.0,LonelyMachines,"They made it their business in the 1980s.  Just about every article on the matter published in the *New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal* of the American Medical Association in from 1985 to 1995 was obviously written to advocate for the banning or reduction of handguns, even when data didn’t line up with that conclusion.

In 1994, Dr. Katherine Christoffel, a member of the CDC-funded Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan was quoted as saying, “guns are a virus that must be eradicated… They are causing an epidemic of death by gunshot, which should be treated like any epidemic…you get rid of the virus…get rid of the guns, get rid of the bullets, and you get rid of deaths.”

Later that year, CDC head Mark Rosenberg told the Washington Post, “we need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like we did with cigarettes. Now it is dirty, deadly and banned.” He also published an article in one journal entitled “The Bullet as Pathogen.”

Then the Republicans took control of Congress, and in 1996, the Dickey Amendment was inserted into an omnibus spending bill. It stated, “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control.” The $2.6 million that had been allotted for gun research was reallocated to the study of brain injuries.

At no point was any money actually cut from the CDC budget. In no way is the CDC prohibited from doing gun research. The only thing the Dickey Amendment does is deny funding for advocacy.  In fact, the Obama administration gave them $10 million in 2013 to do a study on gun violence. The Atlantic called it, “the “Executive Order the NRA Should Fear the Most.”

Then the CDC did their study. The results (which the administration so wanted to be politicized their way) [weren’t what they wanted](https://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/1), so they buried it.

They've wanted to start this drivel up again for decades.  They think the current administration will be supportive.",pe45kc,hava3dx,Scrmike,2,conservative

Even if they have to manufacture it. Because most people have forgotten the history or just don't bother to read it and study it, they must have also forgotten at the same people who helped to build the gulags, we're victims off the gulags themselves because the system of the totalitarianism that is just around the corner favors no one but those who desire complete power and submission. I've tried to show this to people before I spent so much time trying to show people what is just around the corner. My family immigrated to the United States from a country that was on the tail end of the disease that's invading the world now. Many of my family members, I'll never see again because they were victims. They refuse to bow the knee. Maybe a lot of folks have forgotten what the Germans did to the Jews and I'm not talking about the Holocaust. I'm talking about how the vaccines being used to divide and subjugate people isn't anything new. This was done before the blueprint is already written, the only people who fall for this garbage are the self-righteous narcissistic virtue signaling fools who will gladly board the trains and red under neighbors because some government somewhere promised him some kind of safety that they were never intending on delivering. When the devil himself, Bill Gates signs on to help with the vaccines, you should know what you're getting into. The man who advocates for depopulation isn't going to magically turn around and decide he wants to save millions of people. If you took the vaccine, good for you. You made your choice and we're going to make ours. It's amazing that everyone screams from one side of their mouth that the vaccine will save everybody while at the same time condemning those who don't want it. I don't see the problem to be honest, either you believe the vaccine is going to work and it'll keep you safe or you don't believe in anything and you're just a dead fish floating down river with the rest of the dead fish.

If you get the jab, it should be your own choice for your own sake. Don’t force that upon others. If they don’t want it, for whatever reason, and they risk getting sick, that’s their choice, as well it should be. We don’t force People to get vaxxed for polio, influenza or other illnesses, so we shouldn’t do it for covid. Polio was (mostly) defeated, influenza wasn’t. COVID mutates as quickly as influenza. Chances are, we won’t defeat it.

But that’s okay, we don’t have to. Influenza kills as likely as COVID and under the same, if not easier, conditions. We get waves of it every year, and nobody is hysterical about it either. People get the flu all the time. They call in sick, feel like dogshit for 3-5 days, maybe visit the doctor when their fever gets too high, but then they’re fine.

hapn03o,1630175578.0,banana13split,"As this is a pre-print, it’s important to be (extra) cautious when interpreting the results. 

As a scientist, it does make sense to speculate that natural immunity might be stronger than mRNA. This is because the mRNA vaccines train your immune system to recognize only a small part of the virus rather than the whole entity. However, the question becomes, what is the safest way to get *enough* immunity to eliminate the chance of really horrific complications. 

With that in mind- let’s take a look at this paper:

A major missing control group here is the non-vaccinated-naive (had never tested positive). This is important to know because, if the vaccine affords benefit relative to completely naive, it’s a safer way to get some immunity than natural infection (safer in terms of long term damage- vaccine rates of complications are much lower than natural infection rates of complications). Further, the title fails to mention that the results also support other recent papers showing that the strongest immunity seems to be the combination of vaccine and infection. This might suggest that, no matter a patients history of infection, getting the shot does give your body an extra weapon in the fight. 

Again, this is a preprint and it’s always important to compare data across studies. Hence, when scientists present their studies, they often report “this might be the case” or “from this study, we could suggest”. It’s not about being wishy washy, it’s a simple acknowledgment that we could learn something new in the future that changes how we interpreted something. It’s a little bit alarming when findings are presented as simple truth and that’s a good red flag to look for.",pddumf,pddumf,mjprice83,1,conservative

hapzx1n,1630181337.0,Mr_Truttle,"I agree that this paper does not primarily say anything about the best option for immunologically naive individuals. 

However, a *huge* battleground for those of us who have already had and recovered from COVID (as you would expect most young and relatively healthy people to do) has been this  implied false dichotomy that we are either ""fully vaccinated"" or else at just as much risk from COVID as someone who has never had it.

This is a problem because there is at this point a large proportion of the population that has recovered from COVID-19. And it is not at all an immaterial distinction to make when evaluating risk:reward. If you account for the scientific reality that your existing natural immunity is at least as good as - nay, *better than* - vaccination, then suddenly it's not such a slam dunk in favor of getting the vaccine.

This should be kept in mind even as regards the ""extra protection"" the study mentions from a single dose of a vaccine to complement natural immunity. The next question that occurs to me from that point is, if true, is the extra protection significant enough to outweigh any risk from the vaccination? To answer this we need to know not just the likelihood of mere infection, but also the likelihood of severe illness and death. That is, if I am a bit more likely to be reinfected with COVID without a dose of vaccine, but not significantly more likely to be hospitalized or die from it, then there is still not a clear benefit to being vaccinated.",pddumf,hapn03o,banana13split,2,conservative

I'll answer. 

If my age and health demographic already has a 99.99% survival rate, and then I get Covid and my natural immunity brings it to 99.999%, I don't think it is worth the hassle (much less any risk or cost to a national health system) to bring it to 99.9995%.",pddumf,hapqdm0,Rhawk187,2,conservative

If a healthy 30 year old 170lb 25% body fat woman already got covid without issue, a demographic with a covid hospitalization and death rate in the tens of millions, should she risk the side effects of the vaccine?

If you say that her odds of getting severe covid symptoms without the vaccine are say 1/10,000,000 and with the vaccine they are 1/11,000,000, That really isn't an improvement and I wouldn't consider it worth getting the injection.",pddumf,hapqdm0,Rhawk187,2,conservative

The new CDC guidance would apply to immigrants living in the United States seeking to apply for a green card.

“COVID-19 vaccination now meets the criteria for required vaccinations and is a requirement for applicants eligible for the vaccine,” the CDC said on its website.

The agency said that a negative screening for COVID-19, the disease caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, does not guarantee that they won’t have the disease when they become a permanent resident.

“A combination of vaccination and routine infection control practices will provide the best protection from COVID-19 for applicants and U.S. communities,” the CDC asserted.

As such, a green card applicant “must complete the COVID-19 vaccine series and provide documentation of vaccination to the civil surgeon in person” as part of their medical examination.

Something is rotten. CDC still shades all reporting to hype the fear and promote vaccination by not giving any credence to natural immunity, seldom if ever discussing how serious the infections are or segregating the impact of the delta variant on those vaccinated for the alpha variant from unvaccinated. E.G. Israel reports over 50% of serious Covid infections are among fully vaccinated with the most vulnerable (many of whom also received a booster) hit hardest. And if you look at the mortality rate for vaccinated with breakthrough infections, it appears to be much higher than during the original outbreak.  Breakthrough Hospitalizations and deaths [from the NYT 8/1](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/10/us/covid-breakthrough-infections-vaccines.html)0: Idaho  37 hospitalizations with 6 deaths; Illinois 563 hospitalizations 151 deaths; Michigan 569 hospitalizations 223 deaths, etc.

Any company that breaks these laws is fined 500% of its annual income, under threat of being prohibited from trading in and capacity in the aforementioned countries.

To get this done, both Russia and India will require assurances from the US and EU for extended trade relations, meaning we are obliged to give less critique for internal affairs in their countries in favour of trade relations. Aka: we stop giving shits about how putin runs his country, so long as it doesn’t affect other countries.

China’s biggest strength is the amount of people it has and thus the market it provides. If you can outdo them in their game, they lose the advantage. They have no particularly strong military, and with all the countries I just mentioned on one side, China is pretty much surrounded on all sides by equal forces and cut off from military allies. The US can come in via the Eastern sea with Japan as a supply Hub, the EU from the West as an allied force. Russia to the north is geographically cut off from China for the most part, but may still provide air support and long-range recon, as well as electronic warfare, while India to the south could do a large-scale invasion, as they are the closest to Beijing (and definetly the most interested in taking China down, seeing their tensions for the past decades)

Keep in mind Putin and Xi are not military allies. They are trade partners because Putin can’t really trade with the west because the west does not want to trade with Putin because of the way he runs his country. That’s why Putin sticks with China.

When these 4 forces combine, China WILL have to step back.

halc7mh,1630091251.0,SOLlDSNAKE,"I’m 100% pro vaccine and got both shots of Pfizer and will get the booster once it’s time. But the media/public health officials have really muddled the messaging and damaged their credibility for no reason on this weird distinction between vaccinated and naturally immune. Natural immunity is legitimate and scientifically validated by real world studies like this. If we acknowledged that and treated/tracked the naturally immune similar to the fully vaccinated, we’d have a much better picture about how close we are to actually achieving some semblance of herd immunity and how to guide our response to the pandemic better. I assume officials are doing this because they don’t want to “confuse” the public, but the issue is that they are lying and people notice that and become more vaccine hesitant. 

For anyone saying the vaccines suck or are dangerous, the fact that you can have a breakthrough case or still spread the virus when vaccinated doesn’t mean vaccines failed. The vast majority of breakthrough vaxx cases are mild and will not result in hospitalization. 90+% of US hospitalizations and COVID deaths are among the unvaccinated. We can’t become a country that wants to eradicate every case of the virus; we should focus on ensuring our hospital systems don’t collapse and people can live their lives freely. The fact is, we’re going to have to live with the virus, so these countries pursuing “COVID zero” policies through draconian lockdowns are insane. Countries that were praised like Australia have shit vaccination rates and are locking down completely. It’ll never end for them because you have to open up eventually, so the best way forward is vaccinate as many people as possible so the hospitals can function when COVID inevitably circulates again. 

Even after 6 months and with the Delta variant circulating, the vaccines are still significantly more effective than the annual flu vaccine is. Pfizer is fully FDA approved and over 100 million Americans have gotten one of the mRNA vaccines over the past year (and millions have gotten the J&J traditional vaccine).",pcsbwo,pcsbwo,Son0fSun,1,conservative
hamkfqw,1630111100.0,0siris0,"I agree just about everything here.  

The main problem with this whole vaccine messaging has been...vaccine.  

We ain't ever getting away from Covid.  If these jabs were marketed as similar to a traditional annual flu shot, *maybe* people wouldn't be triggered about a *vaccine* rushed into production (although the research on mRNA isn't new).  

Covid will be like the flu, you get your annual flu shot, your annual Covid shot, and move on with your life with a heavily decreased chance of contracting the flu or Covid, and thus spreading it to others.  

George Washington made his soldiers take a small pox prick to prevent spread of small pox.  Vaccine mandates were used in the 20s and 30s for factory workers.   We were less superstitious then that we are now, and that's not good. 

The reality is, everyone will get Covid at some point.  Hopefully not the elderly and immune compromised, but we'll all get it, like we will all get the flu.  

How we get it is what matters.   Do we get it in a jab, or do we get it naturally?   If you get it in a jab, it's a controlled dose.  Your side effects will be infinitesimal than a full viral load.  You won't spread the virus the jab as it was targeted to address.  If you get a jab, it won't *save* you from adaptive variants, nor from spreading adaptive variants.  But it will help reduce side effects, and protect you from the targeted makeup of the virus. 

Or you can get it naturally.  If you get it naturally, you'll have stronger resistance to the current and future strands.  You might also have really really bad side effects.  You will also be more contagious to people who may have a stronger negative reaction to your viral payload.   

There is no other option.  We can't cure the flu or the cold.  Respiratory viruses don't die, they adapt.  

If you are fortunate enough to get Covid naturally and have limited side effects, good.  You shouldn't have to get a vaccine.  If you got Covid and got it bad, I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to get the vaccine.  If you haven't had Covid...you can get the jab or move on.  It's coming for you, like every respiratory virus will.  The wise person would take the jab, and get the jab next year, and get the jab the year after that.  The wise person gets his flu shot every year, there is no grand conspiracy to flood your bloodstream with nanobots so the anti christ can control you.  

I had Covid in October, minimal side effects.   Couldn't taste anything for two weeks and was tired for a week.  Maybe one night of coughing.  Used the time off to put up a couple of ceiling fans and rearrange my house, top to bottom.  I also jog like a crazy person (jogged 3-4 miles a day with Covid), don't smoke, take my vitamin D, get my annual flu shots (which helps against Covid), and have a resting heart rate of about 55.  Nonetheless, I *still* got the jab in May, no side effects from the jab (moderne), in fact took down a fence just to move around after the second shot.  

Get the shot.  It won't kill you, and if you have bad side effects from the jab...then you're the type of person who would get hospitalized if you got the full load.  That's your choice.  Cause you WILL get the virus at some point, and what matters is how bad, and whether you spread it to others because of your paranoia.   Covid shot is Trump's triumph...and too many of his supporters deny him of that by dragging their feet.",pcsbwo,halc7mh,SOLlDSNAKE,2,conservative

If the goal is to save lives in a pandemic, natural immunity is kind of the worst case scenario, ESPECIALLY when you deal with spikes and hospital bed shortages.

I'm starting to feel more comfortable getting it and was planning to get it soon but something I saw the other day stated the covid vaccine programs cells to only attack covid in its current state and once variants continue to come out the vaccine will some how hinder the immune system against these variants and that's why boosters are necessary. That information combined with the vaccinated people still able able get and transmit the infection makes me wonder if the virus will outrun the boosters taking a chunk of lives every time before the next booster is available, I'd my natural immune system had a better shot and has already proven to be able to take covid on, why would I go get vaccinated now? 

From what I understand viruses tend to evolve to not kill their host so future variants should get weaker and I should be able to fight them off like the flu or cold?

I got Covid early on. In the times since, I've been exposed more times than I care to admit. I go into quarantine every time, and every time I haven't gotten sick again. It's been nearly 2 years. 

So why should I take the shot ? Honestly ? My body seems to be quite capable of dealing with each exposure. 

Not saying this is the approach everyone should take. I believe the decision belongs between you and your doctor, not you and the media, politicians, Reddit, or anyone else. Medicine isn't and never has been ""one size fits all"".

Editing to add since a certain population wants to keep downvoting this. Aside from my doctor, here's a great article that is well sourced that explains exactly why my natural immunity is only slightly less (if not superior to, depending on what time & further research has to say about vaccine efficacy) than the vaccine. My odds of not getting it again are around 80%. The jury is still out on yours. Funny how the ""trust the science"" crowd insists upon trusting the government over the scientists and doctors who have been fact checked and can explain it all in great detail.

A vaccine is just a injection with a pathogen that allows the body to CREATE ANTIBODIES and be ready for the next time when the real stuff happens.

In the end the body's own ANTIBODIES will fight off the virus/bacteria not the ""vaccine"".

And since  a vaccine is just a small scale infection, because we don't want to inject people with the real deal, not to mention that the MRA-spike protein-immune-buster (NOT A VACCINE!!!) it is even weaker than a proper vaccine, the antibodies are also weak and they will ""fade"" fast.

Again, the spike-protein-immune-buster ""trains"" the body to attack only the spike-protein that happens to appear at the surface of the virus infected cells. It does not target any other proteins or lipids or the virus itself!

And the body's response fade with time. Because attacking a crappy protein is not something the body remembers for a long time. 

Therefore the ""booster jabs"" try to ""remind"" the body to attack that protein time and time again.

A proper vaccine will have inert virus bodies that can be targeted by the entire immune system, not just a crappy protein!  Vaccines like Astra-Zeneca or Sputnik offer a longer term protection than the lazy made mRNA-messenger cannot offer!

And all vaccines that target flu viruses have the same problem as flu viruses mutate each season. Therefore it is almost impossible to ""vaccinate"" against flu, despite the Big Pharma claims and lies!",pckm08,pckm08,,1,conservative

haivusj,1630043811.0,georgiedawn,"This probably is the definition of a bittersweet ending. This whole moratorium was a nightmare situation to begin with and is now going to get alot worse. On one hand, I 100% the moratorium had no legal ground. The CDC should not be allowed to make rules on housing evictions - they're a health agency not the Department of Housing. Also, one should not force homeowners to not take rent, when they have mortgages to pay. Many aren't giant property owners - just people looking to supplement income. It's not right to force someone to host someone for free. There was no mortgage freeze to match the eviction freeze.

However, I am extremely worried about all the people who are suddenly going to get evicted. Afghanistan was a shitshow this week. The evictions are going to be a lot worse. The Aspen Institute estimates **30-40M people are at risk once the eviction moratorium ends**. I don't know if most of us even grasp this - that's **10% of all Americans** that are suddenly homeless - it's completely unprecedented. I'm not so ridiculous to think that everyone of them will get evicted but still, assuming 50% of them do, it's not like there's 5M extra homes available on the market for these families to move into. Moreover, who will rent to these Americans given they've defaulted on their rent and have a shitty credit score? I frankly don't know what we can do to mitigate the shitshow that is about to happen unless the Biden administration can figure out what to do about all those families.",pcdj7g,pcdj7g,learnt0read,1,conservative

Take a look at my comment above. Most are just squatting taking advantage of the system while people like my parents get shit on. For a landlord to report a tenant to damage their credit score is much more a hassle than its worth. For alot of property owners they just want them out so they can rent to someone that will actually pay rent. Seeing what they've been going through, it amazes me how much the housing system is slanted to protect tenants, even before covid. When that ban on evictions was put in place all tenants like the ones they're dealing with saw was dollar signs. The ones that decided to milk it and hide behind bidens ban, not pay rent and fuck their landlords are now going to be bit in the ass. Big time.",pcdj7g,haivusj,georgiedawn,2,conservative

EDIT: If anyone can provide a source showing that getting vaccinated reduces the likelihood of getting infected with Covid or transmitting Covid to others, I would be very grateful.

Until then, I’m going to use reports like the following to inform my perspective on Covid:

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/grim-warning-israel-vaccination-blunts-does-not-defeat-delta

> Israel has among the world’s highest levels of vaccination for COVID-19, with **78% of those 12 and older fully vaccinated, the vast majority with the Pfizer vaccine.** Yet the country is now logging one of the world’s highest infection rates, with nearly 650 new cases daily per million people. More than half are in fully vaccinated people, underscoring the extraordinary transmissibility of the Delta variant and stoking concerns that the benefits of vaccination ebb over time.

> What is clear is that “breakthrough” cases are not the rare events the term implies. As of 15 August, **514 Israelis were hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19,** a 31% increase from just 4 days earlier. **Of the 514, 59% were fully vaccinated**. Of the vaccinated, 87% were 60 or older.

**The evidence shows that the Pfizer Covid vaccine is not effective in preventing anyone from either catching or transmitting Covid (Delta variant).**

Dr. Robert Malone Update

The FDA authorized a “vaccine” that DOES NOT currently exist.

They issued two separate letters FOR TWO SEPARATE “VACCINES”!

The Pfizer vaccine, which is what is currently being given IS STILL UNDER EUA, which still has the liability shield.

The MSM is lying to EVERYONE, again!

This is what Sidney Powell would call a word game or word salad.

The product that WAS LICENSED is the BioNtech product “COMIRNATY” as detailed on Page 2, first paragraph. Here 👇 
https://www.fda.gov/media/150386/download

The BioNTech product that got the BAL approval is similar to the already available Pfizer “vaccine”, but it is NOT THE SAME VACCINE and “COMIRNATY” it isn’t even created or labeled yet.

The FDA, MSM, & Pfizer are ALL coercing the world into believe the Pfizer jab was FDA approved.

Fuck him. That is a piece of shit and he deserves the damn chair in my opinion.

I live in a state that takes security work more seriously than the paul blart mall cop guard shit most are used to dealing with. You have to go through certification courses, meet licensing  requirements, and then are assigned a level designation based on your training and certification to be either a non-commissioned or commisioned security officer, and the state vests you with powers based on your status and your assignments.

When you go through the coursework, in this state that takes security more seriously, and which is a self defense paradise, they make sure to tell you over and over that if you feel the need to escalate to lethal force you better be damn well sure. You are required to read and memorize many sections of the Criminal Code of Justice in relation to arresting, use of force, etc but also the 2 sections on self defense and defense of a 3rd party, and specifically what does and does not constitute a justification for lethal force in self defense and defense of a 3rd party. When stating a defense of lethal force to protect a 3rd party it is NOT a defense unless the 3rd party was reasonably in immediate risk of injury or death at the hands of the other party, and in self defense  the individual must have reasonably been in immediate risk of injury or death. There is no requirement that the defending party or the 3rd party must retreat before using lethal force, only that a reasonable person would conclude at that moment that life or limb was in IMMEDIATE danger.

When someone with HIV spits in the face of a Police Officer, thats a high charge of assaulting a peace officer, and the charge could be escalated higher based on the evidence and the DA. Yet thats not even a valid use of lethal force for police...how the fuck is a security guy going to believe not wearing a mask because ""mu covid spread"" is a calid use of leathal force???

And furthermore, what fucking company was employing him as an armed guard? Was it the store itself, or was he contracted through a security firm/agency?

The data from Israel disagrees. Look at their cases AND deaths on world meters. You would not be able to tell they were vaccinated (and especially deaths where you'd expect an order of magnitude lower number if 90%+ vulnerable people have already been vaccinated).

> Condoms work 96% of the time if used properly

So do many other things. Someone who visits 10 friends will spread the virus twice as much as someone who only visits 5. So should we mandate these other reduction factors as well? Someone who is unvaccinated but keeps relatively to themselves can be less of a danger than someone who is vaccinated and does not. There is no logical consistency there.

Compare the externality of being unvaccinated toward the vaccinated and compare it to other externalities of similar risk. You'll find that we DO NOT treat those other externalities the same way (for example - contact with someone who is unvaccinated will pose the same risk of death to a vaccinated person as contact with someone who might have the flu, according to FDA approval numbers, yet we never mandated anything for the flu case).

I agree your point is a valid counter to the original argument, however, the original argument wasn't complete. As you can see your point can in turn be countered as well when we elaborate on the details further.

There are probabilities other than 0, 50, and 100%. 

If a vaccine greatly reduces the likelihood that you'll get the disease, and/or greatly reduces the likelihood of spreading it, it definitely makes sense to keep track of who has it.

All these policies should be data driven to see if they are worth the time and effort.

*The upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11, religious holidays and more pandemic restrictions amid a COVID-19 surge caused by the delta variant, could give rise to terrorist attacks in the U.S, the Department of Homeland Security is warning.

DHS’ National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin issued on Friday, warned that threats from domestic terrorists — individuals engaged in grievance-based violence — and foreign terrorists are exacerbated by the pandemic, “including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions.”

The bulletin said that racially or ethnically motivated extremists will exploit the reintroduction of COVID-19 variants as a means to carry out attacks because of reimplemented pandemic restrictions.

They also warned about the intense disinformation:

*DHS also cautioned about foreign and domestic groups as well as foreign intelligence services (but did not specify which ones) that “continue to introduce, amplify, and disseminate narratives online that promote violence, and have called for violence against elected officials, political representatives, government facilities, law enforcement, religious communities or commercial facilities, and perceived ideologically-opposed individuals.”*

“Law enforcement have expressed concerns that the broader sharing of false narratives and conspiracy theories will gain traction in mainstream environments, resulting in individuals or small groups embracing violent tactics to achieve their desired objectives. With a diverse array of threats, DHS is concerned that increased outbreaks of violence in some locations, as well as targeted attacks against law enforcement, may strain local resources,” the bulletin reads.

Some domestic violent extremists “continue to derive inspiration and obtain operational guidance through the consumption of information shared in certain online communities. This includes information regarding the use of improvised explosive devices and small arms.”*

> Israel has among the world’s highest levels of vaccination for COVID-19, **with 78% of those 12 and older fully vaccinated, the vast majority with the Pfizer vaccine**. Yet the country is now logging one of the world’s highest infection rates, with nearly 650 new cases daily per million people. **More than half are in fully vaccinated people, underscoring the extraordinary transmissibility of the Delta variant and stoking concerns that the benefits of vaccination ebb over time.**

> What is clear is that “breakthrough” cases are not the rare events the term implies. As of 15 August, 514 Israelis were hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19, a 31% increase from just 4 days earlier. **Of the 514, 59% were fully vaccinated.** Of the vaccinated, 87% were 60 or older.

**The evidence shows that the Pfizer Covid vaccine is not effective in preventing anyone from either catching or transmitting Covid (Delta variant).**

They'll ban your ass with the quickness. **But if I go into r/communism and start shitting on their failed ideology, I expect to be banned.**

I posted this earlier I  reply to another thread with context to Republicans are the only ones being anti vax. It's currently, surprisingly, still at positive 3 upvotes. I just copied and pasted here  so forget about the nurses bit, but some of the people in the final link, are nurses against the firing of nurses for rejecting the vaccine. But proof is there, that they're pro-vax lmao.

Do y'all believe in conspiracies? Hear me out, do you think it's possible, that there are either, bot accounts claiming to be conservative and screaming anti vax, or fake accounts even? And that these liberal *""journalists""* are just eating that shit up as the truth, and spreading it everywhere exclaiming it's only the Republicans that are such. And another thing, we're pretty much 50/50 in here, in regards to being vaccinated or not. That alone puts a huge damper on their narrative of anti vax conservatives. 

Do you understand what's really going on? If you look up anything about Republicans or conservatives on Google, we're racist, murderous, anti-vax, facists, ignorant, poor morons. (Missing any?)

It's ridiculous.

If you don't want to take the vaccine, OK. I highly disagree with your choice and think it's irresponsible. But don't justify it with made up nonsense like insisting that the vaccines are ""untested"", that the vaccines ""don't work"" (efficacy is NOT binary, people!), or promote medical quackery in the form of ivermectin, which the jury is still out on and is NOT a proven treatment for COVID! The thing that really gets me the most is that we've had extremely thorough and great medical trials on the COVID shots (Pfizer's trial alone was 10x the size of a standard vaccine trial out of caution), but folks reject those and want to take ivermectin which is still in ongoing trials for COVID treatment and the data is at best inconclusive. I'm sorry, what? That makes literally zero sense. You reject the shots because you don't think they've been tested enough but you'll take ivermectin which has not yet been clinically proven (yet) to treat COVID?

I'm actually surprised. Your immune system typically goes into contraction after a while, and antibodies wane. Good thing is that antibodies are great and all, but lasting and broad immunity is really conferred by t-cells (especially memory t-cells), which don't make antibodies.

I wish we'd go off of the [exceptionally low rates of reinfection](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/08/covid-19-reinfection-tracker/) (169 confirmed cases and 82,000 suspected worldwide) to show how rare reinfections are. Even if we give the panic fetishists the benefit of the doubt and say that there have been 80,000 cases of reinfection worldwide, that would mean that of the [192 million people](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) who have had COVID and recovered, only 0.0428% of people got infected again. 

Bottom line is that it's super rare to get infected twice even if you're not showing an appreciable antibody titer.

Edited for accuracy: I originally reported the total number of global infections (roughly 215 million).

The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) said in a recent release that the state has recovered 964,400 jobs of those lost when the pandemic struck last spring, which threw the economy into a tailspin and led to a sharp rise in unemployment.

Jerry Parrish, chief economist at the Florida Chamber of Commerce, said the Sunshine State economy now remains just over 315,000 jobs down compared to the pre-pandemic period.

“We still have a few to go to get back to the pre-COVID peak of more than 9 million non-farm jobs” in Florida, Parrish said in a video presentation that’s part of the August edition of the chamber’s monthly overview of the latest jobs figures and other economic data.

Around two-thirds of the jobs that have yet to be recovered in Florida are in leisure and hospitality, with Parrish saying that the pace of job recovery in that sector is accelerating.

July marked Florida’s 15th consecutive month of job growth, with the DEO announcing that the state gained 63,900 private-sector jobs over the month. That’s the largest monthly increase in private sector jobs since June of last year, when the economy saw a sharp bounce back from the pandemic lows.

For 12 consecutive months, Florida’s unemployment rate—at 5.1 percent in July—has remained below the national rate, which last month stood at 5.4 percent, according to the Labor Department.*",pbk2zb,pbk2zb,XIIXOO,1,conservative

It has over 500k subscribers and was solely for posting, making fun of, and celebrating people who were infected with COVID and either passed away from it or were actively fighting for their lives. They justified it by poking fun of those individual's opinions about the vaccines and how them getting sick or dying from the disease is somehow a cathartic justification for them to laugh at these people. It was disgusting.

No matter which side of the argument you're on about these vaccinations, no one should be celebrating the tragic deaths or medical struggles of other human beings. It reeks of the disgusting way people treated those who had contracted AIDS back in the 60s-80s. People justified their abhorrent treatment of AIDS sufferers because they saw it as a ""consequence"" of those people's ""risky"" life choices. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now. So how is this any different?

That subreddit is a perfect reflection of the ignorant, often hypocritical, and callous nature of the modern-day left. These same people who laugh and mock others for their suffering and loss of life would be the same morally bankrupt monsters who would make fun of an AIDS patient back in the day.

For years I had the same philosophy as you, where I believed government should stay hands-off and not interfere with businesses. But these past few years of leftist overreach have made me change my mind.


The issue is simple: the left constantly uses the government to impose its will on the populace. The right has always opposed using the government to promote its views because like you said, conservatism believes in a hands-off approach. This has led to asymmetrical warfare. If your enemy is shooting at you and you say *“I’m not going to return fire because shooting people is wrong”,* then the result will be that you get shot and your enemy wins.

I wish it weren’t that way, but that’s reality. I’ve been libertarian-leaning for most of my life, and I’ve seen the culture fall to the left as a result. These last few years were the culmination of that, with the left moving so far leftward because they’ve controlled the media and the eduction system and Silicon Valley and Hollywood and corporate America, and the result is that conservatives have been trampled.

All of that has led me to realize that a pure libertarian approach simply doesn’t work. We have to use government to promote our Western values or else our enemy will use government to impose their socialist, tyrannical values on all of us. That’s exactly what they’ve been doing for years and it’s why  conservatism has been such a failure for the past 30 years.",pbf225,habcwcx,uniquecannon,2,conservative

There were already so many recalls and lawsuits over drugs and treatments that were approved, that approval kind of doesn't mean much anymore, if it ever really did. FDA approval is simply a justification to eliminate any grounds by which to refuse, and any recourse one might have if forced.

Although Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2-immune sera neutralized the Delta variant, when four common mutations were introduced into the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Delta variant (Delta 4+), some BNT162b2-immune sera lost neutralizing activity and enhanced the infectivity. Unique mutations in the Delta NTD were involved in the enhanced infectivity by the BNT162b2-immune sera. Sera of mice immunized by Delta spike, but not wild-type spike, consistently neutralized the Delta 4+ variant without enhancing infectivity.

Although Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2-immune sera neutralized the Delta variant, when four common mutations were introduced into the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Delta variant (Delta 4+), some BNT162b2-immune sera lost neutralizing activity and enhanced the infectivity. Unique mutations in the Delta NTD were involved in the enhanced infectivity by the BNT162b2-immune sera. Sera of mice immunized by Delta spike, but not wild-type spike, consistently neutralized the Delta 4+ variant without enhancing infectivity. Given the fact that a Delta variant with three similar RBD mutations has already emerged according to the GISAID database, it is necessary to develop vaccines that protect against such complete breakthrough variants.",pb557j,pb557j,pubgjun,1,conservative

The UK just stopped mask mandates for children and they also include in their numbers people that have natural immunities from the actual Covid infection which took the UK to 93% immunity.  Pretty darned good number.  If OUR country would stop the fear mongering and include people with natural and better antibodies along with the vaccinated people would shut up with their criticism of those that haven't been vaccinated.  It's actually called herd immunity.  They don't want to share the numbers because they don't have their FEAR talking point.  They're already losing control of their narrative.

>**K.2.   What are some examples of reasonable accommodations or modifications that employers may have to provide to employees who do not get vaccinated due to disability; religious beliefs, practices, or observance; or pregnancy?**  (5/28/21)  
An employee who does not get vaccinated due to a disability (covered by the ADA) or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance (covered by Title VII) may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation that does not pose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business.  For example, as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance from coworkers or non-employees, work a modified shift, get periodic tests for COVID-19, be given the opportunity to telework, or finally, accept a reassignment.   
Employees who are not vaccinated because of pregnancy may be entitled (under Title VII) to adjustments to keep working, if the employer makes modifications or exceptions for other employees.  These modifications may be the same as the accommodations made for an employee based on disability or religion.

Anyone recall a story about Whigs, Tories, and Tarheels? How 2,000 Tarheels with balls so big I don’t know how they fit in their trousers, led an armed rebellion to regulate a royal governor and corrupt local officials? Yes they were crushed, but things would go in their favor on down the road.

Or how those who favored independence (Whigs) set up their own Provincial Congress? Which later put forth the Halifax Resolves calling for a United drive for independence. Only to then begin figuring out how to place the power of government IN THE PEOPLE. Then adopting a bill of civil rights BEFORE adopting their form of government, which showed exactly how important individual liberties were to a people who were fighting against what they believed was an oppressive government. The ideal of ""government by the citizens and for the citizens"" was a highly combustive fuel that fired the revolutionary vision of a just society.

A 15-year-old girl was allegedly forced to wear an ankle tracking monitor for volleyball practice at Eatonville High School in Washington state as a condition of participating in team sports. This was required of both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.

According to her mother who spoke anonymously to The Post Millennial, her daughter was at a practice for the public school's volleyball team and texted her that she was being asked to put on an ankle monitor.

The teen did not answer the mother's follow up texts or calls. The mother assumed she was playing during practice and attempted to contact the school via phone. No one at the school was able to answer her questions about the monitor, so she drove to the building.

The mother spoke to an employee in the school office, as well as a coach and was informed there was a meeting last week discussing the ankle monitoring program for unvaccinated teens. The program was allegedly designed for contact tracing in the event of a positive COVID test of a student.

The TraceTag device used by the school was made by a company called Triax. According to their website, the device was created for the purposse of ""maintaining social distancing guidelines"" and to provide ""real-time insight into whether these guidelines are being observed"" for construction and other manufacturing businesses, but makes no mention of school use on the website.

The devices provide ""…a visual and audible alarm, so individuals know when to adjust their current distance to a proper social distance.""Additionally, the monitors provide ""Passive collection of worker interactions for contact tracing should an individual test positive.""

According to Triax, the device ""…is affixed to any hardhat or worn on the body for proximity detection and contact tracing.""The mother identified the coach as Gavin Kralik, who told her that the device would inform the players when they were too close together and was only used for indoor sports. She was also informed that the device would be used for contract tracing so that in the event of a positive test, non-vaccinated students would have to quarantine for up to 14 days. Vaccinated students would not have to quarantine.The devices were not mentioned in the district's back-to-school policies for fall 2021.

The mother said she was told by Kralik that there were forms to opt-out of the program at a meeting the previous week which she was not informed about and additionally, had received no communication about the meeting or the devices. According to the mother, the athletic director acknowledged the error and apologized for the ""slip up"" of not getting her consent.

The mother said that when she told the school employees that she was taking her daughter home, the teen was asked by an office staff member to remove the device before she saw her mother and said that the mother could only photograph the device in Kralik's hand as pictured above, not on the child's ankle.

Adding to the intrigue, the school board was approached by Kralik, one of the school's athletic directors, about a program involving a tracking system to help prevent quarantines for the football team. The devices were described as a way to prevent and reduce regular testing. The devices would only be used on the field. A radio toggle, which would not have cellular or GPS capability would be placed on the football helmets and a local booster club was willing to pay for the system.

No decision has been yet authorized and the board is set to convene Wednesday to discuss the program in more detail. Under the rules of the board, the body must vote to accept donations before any programs are paid for, even if they are fully funded.This would not be the first time someone has gone rogue regarding teen sports in the area. During the 2020-2021 season, a local youth sports association called the police on Eatonville parents who were not wearing masks outside at games.

Prepare for a hurricane: Take basic steps now to ensure your safety should a storm hit.
Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. COVID-19 vaccines help protect you from getting sick or severely ill with COVID-19 and may also help protect people around you.
Get emergency supplies: Stock your home and your car with supplies. Give yourself more time than usual to prepare your emergency food, water, and medicine supplies. Home delivery is the safest choice for buying disaster supplies; however, that may not be an option for everyone. If in-person shopping is your only choice, take steps to protect your and others’ health when running essential errands.
Make a plan: Create a family disaster plan.
Prepare to evacuate: Never ignore an evacuation order. Pay attention to local guidance about updated plans for evacuations and shelters, including shelters for your pets.
Protect older adults: Understand older adult health and medical concerns.
Protect your pets: Ensure your pet’s safety before, during, and after a hurricane.

Excerpt from:

https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/current-constitutional-issues-related-to-vaccine-mandates

""In general, two key Supreme Court decisions speak to the authority of state and local officials to issue vaccine mandates.  Generally, these decisions concluded that these governments may tell people to get vaccines, unless they belong to an exempt group, or face a penalty. In 1905, the Supreme Court ruled in Jacobson vs. Massachusetts that under a state law local health authorities could compel adults to receive the smallpox vaccine. Henning Jacobson refused a free smallpox vaccination that was mandated by the city of Cambridge; he was fined five dollars as a result. Jacobson argued the vaccination law violated his 14th Amendment due process rights.  
Justice John Marshall Harlan, writing for court’s majority, concluded that states under their general police powers had the ability to enact vaccine laws to protect citizens. Police powers allow a state to pass laws to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. “It is for the legislature, and not for the courts, to determine in the first instance whether vaccination is or is not the best mode for the prevention of smallpox and the protection of the public health,” Harlan wrote.  
The second decision, Zucht v. King in 1922, arrived at a similar conclusion. San Antonio, Texas, excluded students from public and private schools who were not vaccinated for smallpox. This included the challenger in the case, Rosalyn Zucht. Her attorneys argued the vaccine policy violated Zucht’s 14th Amendment due process rights. Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in the Court’s decision that “long before this suit was instituted, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, had settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination.”""",pal9ce,ha5f6x1,ArthurFrood,2,conservative

This was even used in the supreme court case of Buck vs. Bell and the court ruled that it was legal **for the state of mandate involuntary sterilization** (for the ""feeble minded"" that is). Now so far we have not *yet* seen fines for not getting the covid vaccine but lets not let the Biden administration and the house from getting any ideas. But business denying services or work for is the now. Unless you have some kind of thing that you can hold agents them that would hurt business if they did not work with you, but I suspect that they would call Eminent Domain and take what you have so they (bussiness) don't have that problem.

You ""choose"" to be poked, or you ""choose"" to lose your job, your ability to rent a place to live, access to stores, public spaces/transit, etc. The intention is to financially drain the American public into compliance.To so completely excommunicate the unvaxxed from ""polite' society, that to refuse is borderline impossible. 

This intention seems especially obvious in the face of the prior months of free assistance, food and cash benefits, etc. Tell me it's not reminiscent of communist bread lines. Let's get as many people as possible nice and comfortable with being on the govt dole. Reliant on uncle S for housing, for food, for medical insurance. So that when those ""benefits"" inevitably become available only to the vaxxed, it's just more motivation to comply.

After that, they'll come for the stragglers. Door to door. It's all for the greater good. They only want to give easy access to everybody. It has nothing to do with wanting a list of holdouts.

The claim: not getting vaccinated endangers other people.

The dots (according to cdc):  the vaccine reduces your symptoms.

Asymptomatic spread is possible, and likely largest transmission vector.

Vaccinated people can have breakthrough cases.

Vast majority of people only get tested with symptoms or very close contact with people with symptoms.

So, let’s connect dots.   Vaccinated people are getting sick as often as unvaccinated, but are symptomatic at a much lower rate, about 5-10x lower best I can tell from the data.   But this means they are spreading asymptomatic 5-10x as often, and due to the lower asymptomatic rate, it can jump through 10 people before one is symptomatic, with everyone along the way providing mutable pathways.  

So, connecting the dots, the vaccinated look to be the hidden repository for this virus as it is harder to trace the path of contagion with it showing symptoms even more sporadically.

So, proof?  Israel, since they have a more rigorous testing regimen.   The vaccines are showing only beneficial in reducing symptoms/reducing mortality of the vaccinated (which is good!).

No advice on how to use otc measures or any prescriptions to treat the symptoms. Also as you notice that number is not 100 percent unvaccinated which means we are having a influx of vac and unvac. Instead of belittling why don’t you get on the train of every single person deserves care. The media and one doctor have struck fear in everyone. People are scared and people are panicking. If 100 people in front of a doctor have cancer just understand the same medication and plan does not work for all 100. The unvaccinated unfortunately are not the problem nor are the vaccinated.

You won't get any adequate study results anytime soon. Still too new.

The vaccine type is very different from many of the previous vaccines that have ever been developed. 

My wife got her Moderna vaccine pregnant. Our baby is health as can be, except for some mild GERD. She also had GERD with her daughter (my step-daughter), so we attribute that more to genetics rather than any side-effects of the vaccine or anything else.

It's not like the Progressives automatically have any positive virtues in opposition--they are their own dumpster fire but in different ways.  

It is true that one is statistically unlikely to die from Covid once they get it.  It is also true that it's foolish to treat those deaths as just a tiny percentage instead of a human life, one of the main tenets of conservatism is the respect for the individual and his and her intrinsic value *as* an individual and not a number.  

It's true the government lockdowns are unnecessary and immoral.  It is also true the flippancy of the anti-vax crowd is immoral and idiotic as well.  

It is true that, outside of age, morbid obesity is the main cause of death and hospitalizations.   It is also true that it's just cruel to throw ones hands up and say, ""whelp, them fatties deserve it, I BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY IN SPREADING THE VIRUS, NO MASKS NOR JAB FOR ME!""  

Just like it's statistically unlikely a young-ish healthy person would die of Covid, it is even MORE unlikely that a vaccinated person would have any side effects.  It is contradictory to use ""Covid isn't the deadly killer the media makes it out to be, those instances where some young person gets hospitalized are exceedingly rare!"" And then turn around and say ""But that vaccine can give you a heart attack, I knew a guy who knew a guy who died of the vaccine!!!""   It's cognitive dissonance and illogical.

Resources are finite and difficult choices must sometimes be made. Those who wilfully go unvaccinated made their own choice and, as we know, choices have consequences. Personal responsibility and all that.

With these simple facts, and inside info that there are plenty of supplies available and many, if not most, cases are relatively minor.  Minor being flu-like symptoms with mild hypoxia that does not require ventilation.

Further, it is both unjust and unnecessary to force all to vaccinate. The majority of infections have been minor or asymptomatic.  Being vaccinated serves only to protect the individual, so if complications are relatively rare, considering the virus's spread rate, then you are under no personal obligation. 

Also, I remember one of the excuses for lockdowns and mask requirements being that you are most infectious when asymptomatic.  The most recent studies show that vaccinated individuals have the same viral load, and therefore the same contagious capacity, as unvaccinated. With the reduced severity and prevalence of covid symptoms in vaccinated individuals, they wouldn't know they are carrying the virus to begin with, making them the ultimate carrier, little more than a Trojan horse made of flesh.

Not at all. It is important to question any decision in your life, including medical decisions. I'm glad you are doing research for yourself. 

That said, I think it is likely that we will be getting boosters for different variants for a while, similar to flu vaccines. 

Being 25 and healthy, the odds are overwhelmingly on your side that Covid will not effect you in any severe way.  Although, every infection of someone young and healthy only furthers the spread to those who are not.  Even those 60 or older who are vaccinated are not FULLY protected.  The vaccine is not 100%, so those with comorbidities whoa are vaccinated still do have a slight risk if they are exposed to covid.

The left will take a number like that and project death onto the vaccinated. And worse, they will make the vaccinated wear masks to protect the unvaccinated. The mask mandates are largely ignored by the ruling elite who frequently are caught without them, and they are mainly there to disrupt lives and put our society in a state of fear where we do not critically examine the abyssal governance of our fraudulently elected puppet of China.

It is true that a disease can mutate to the point where the antibodies in your body no longer 'recognize' the disease, thus you now have a new 'vaccine resistant' variant of the disease that you will need to get a new vaccine for. But the whole goal with a vaccine is to give a population herd immunity before the disease can evolve (b/c otherwise, you have to start over) without most of the bad effects of the disease like death or deviating long term effects....right now we are very close to failing in vaccinating enough of the population to gain herd immunity.....as for a lot of antibacterial soap, the soap physically rips the bacteria apart via the separation of the water and oil in the single celled organism (it would be the equivalent of turning a person inside out but on a cellular level), there is some risk of resistant bacteria but it is quite minimum due to the nature of how it all works.",p9oapo,h9zia66,mattb1969,2,conservative

Israel has a very high percentage of their population vaccinated and they have been vaccinating the longest. But because they weren't offering boosters early, they ended up having a large breakout.

I do not support any mandates what so ever. I think we need transparency and honestly. The Biden administration was blaming the unvaccinated for our breakout while a mostly vaccinated country like Israel was having a similar breakout. That was idiotic.

But offering booster shots is not a mistake in terms of preventing infection and spread of COVID. There are many at risk individuals, who should want to get a booster after 6 to 8 months. My guess is that that booster will give them another 6-8 months of safety and then they will need another booster. If you're healthy and don't mind risking getting sick and getting other people in your life sick, then I see no reason to get a booster, but know that over time you can catch and spread COVID like any unvaccinated person.

I am not anti vax. I have received all my usual immunizations as have my children. Virus is real and dangerous to certain groups of people, but virus is basically 0 threat to me based on my age and health. Still debating on getting vaccinated or not, the whole ""get it or else"" from the gov and media doesn't help. My cloth mask that I wore back in the day to virtue signal and then remove while seated at a restaurant offers basically 0 protection compared to the fitted N95 my wife wears as a nurse. 

Media and Gov (see birthday party, hair appointment, photo op hypocrisies) definitely are fear mongering, for most people Covid isn't a very big threat. There was a new article in my state about how if you don't get vaccinated you will get the virus and you WILL be hospitalized. I think people over 45 or 50 should definitely get vaccinated, especially if they are obese (most of the US) and have other conditions, but it is their choice to make.

We don't know how many people have already had Covid and didn't know/weren't tested, but with those numbers and the vaccinated we should already be close to herd immunity? Yet you would think it is the end of the world. The media and gov basically discount people that have already had it and have natural antibodies. 

I am also sick of having conflicting information or a lack of information that isn't easily accessible for me to make my own decision. I haven't been able to find a good estimate on how much less likely you are to not spread Covid if vaccinated, they just say you are less likely.

You were not even allowed to ask a patient if they had previously had an HIV test, let alone ask them if they were HIV positive or had AIDS!!!  That was grounds for immediate dismissal!  ONLY A PHYSICIAN could approach a patient to ask them any of these questions! You could not do an HIV test on someone without a special consent form being signed by patient and doctor.  Then, once the results came in, the results weren't even allowed to be placed on the chart to protect a patient's privacy!

I got the two stabs in April when they opened up in my state for my age bracket.  I was told this was needed to get back to normal.  I like to travel, hate wearing the masks, and had covid back in February.  But if I wanted to travel, people were talking about vaccine passports and not letting you in without proof.

We were told the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective against reinfection, higher than normal vaccines and it gave me hope.  Then we find out it’s only 39% effective - but at least you won’t end up in the hospital.  Except I didn’t end up in the hospital the first time I had it, and don’t see any indication that reinfection would anyways.

I have both antibody types now, but when traveling I need to still wear masks, get a COVID test exiting and entering the country, show pages of proof... and some chief epidemiologists are saying we’ll probably need to keep these controls in place for 15 years.

The office I work in, which was allowing people to come back in and work now wants everyone masked at their desk all day long, even if you’ve been vaccinated.

Necropsy of the tumor found a 97% penetration of the tumor by my immune system T cells.  The agent flushed out of my body within weeks of the treatments, but it has taught my body to fight these specific cells.  

mRNA works in a similar fashion.  It teaches your immune system to attack a specific antigen associated with Covid, then it leaves your body.  It never enters cells nuclei.

h9yeme3,1629666756.0,Bo_Jim,">How many of the vaccinated would have taken the jab if they knew then what they know today?

I would. There are side effects that weren't yet known after the initial clinical trials, but they are extremely rare. The vaccines have proven to be less effective at preventing infection than originally believed, especially against the Delta strain - as low as 39%, according to the Israel Ministry of Health. But all of the data indicates that they are very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death.

The bottom line, from what we know so far, is that the vaccinated can still catch and spread COVID, but are less likely to get sick and die from it. That ""99% survival"" rate doesn't mean shit to me. That's the average over the entire population. I'm in my 60's, and have factors that increase my risk of serious illness. It scares the shit out of me to see someone half my age and healthier than I am die from COVID. Based on what I know now, I absolutely would still have gotten vaccinated.

I had COVID back in February. It was not the Delta strain. I was very sick for only about two days. I had headaches and loss of taste for nearly two weeks. I started loading up on zinc and vitamin D the first day, and my symptoms started to subside within 12 hours. I am absolutely certain those supplements, especially the zinc, are the reason the infection never made it to my lower respiratory system. If it had then I would have ended up in the hospital, and there's a good chance I would not have left vertically.

If you're young and healthy, and you believe your risk from COVID isn't enough to justify getting a vaccine with known negative side effects, and completely unknown long term negative effects, then I don't blame you one bit for refusing to get vaccinated. I don't believe anyone should force you to get vaccinated, or that you should lose your job, or be denied access to services or businesses for that choice.

Over the last 18 months we have seen some disturbing extremism from government in places like Canada, Britain and Australia.  I like these three countries because they most closely resemble ours in culture and law.  BUT there is one big difference our constitution!  Basically under their law and whatever form of constitution they may have they are subjects.  Whatever rights may be provided or outlined in said laws/constitution are granted by the government and can be suspended by the government with little effort or justification.  Our constitution is the total opposite.  Our rights are natural, we are born with them.  Our constitution enumerates them and then proceeds to list the things the Federal Government can't do.  The point being there is very little preventing other government's from doing whatever they want.  Shooting dog's today shooting people tomorrow!  We saw some very disturbing glimpses of government run amok here with power thirsty governors and mayors. In some cases deaths occurred due to policies set forth by those politicians.  Thankfully states have moved to change laws restricting governors emergency powers.  I would suggest we do more to restrict government and buttress  our rights more, especially in an emergency.

Lastly, they were mature enough to know what they didn't know (i.e., they new the fatality rate would be lower than what was being reported at that time, since only serious cases were being reported, but they admitted they didn't know what it would really be).

Viral loads are the same for breakthrough cases in vaccinated people as in unvaccinated people, but the unvaccinated have no protection unless they were previously infected so they are far more likely to get it in the first place, and the virus also lasts longer in them. That means that the unvaccinated are putting themselves at higher risk, and everyone else too because they are more likely to contract it and have it for longer, giving them more opportunities to spread it than the vaccinated.

The infection rate being similar between both groups is blatantly false.

If you have natural immunity as proven by a test, then yes, the vaccine would not necessarily help you at the moment. That’s acknowledged in most research, so the only people not recognizing it are the media. It’s not new news that the media pushes weird narratives. That hardly seems relevant.

Adverse reactions to the vaccines are extremely rare, even more so than a young and healthy person dying or facing adverse long-term effects from COVID.

The vast majority of studies suggest that masks do serve a purpose. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6549/1439 https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118 https://www.uab.edu/news/health/item/12230-uab-study-among-others-shows-masks-are-effective-in-preventing-spread-of-covid-19 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536

The argument against mandates is that the government has no right to tell you what to do or that these circumstances do not justify an expansion of government power. That’s it.

The government have to choose between waiting much longer until the vaccine is completely safe or use it as soon as possible, hoping to weed out the number of covid infected people ASAP

h9qu6yi,1629514201.0,XIIXOO,"Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont issued an executive order that allows patients and their doctors to access patients’ own COVID-19 vaccination digital records stored in the state information system. The order also permits local health officials and school nurses to access the vaccination status of people in their communities.

Gov. Lamont announced on Thursday that patients and their health care providers would be granted access to patients’ COVID-19 vaccination history, according to a statement.

Connecticut state statutes currently prevent vaccination records from being released to patients and health care providers, the statement said.

The decree will allow individuals to obtain a copy of their immunization records to satisfy vaccine mandates put in place by employers and businesses.

Health care providers will be allowed to see their patient’s vaccination history, for example, if they needed to administer vaccine boosters, instead of keeping track of it on their own, the statement said.

Local health authorities will be permitted to access the vaccination status of people within their jurisdictions to assess the vaccination status of their community, the statement said.

According to the statement, many communities in Connecticut are still below herd immunity thresholds for COVID-19, so vaccination status data will be used to inform community outreach efforts.

“Specifically, school nurses and local health directors will be equipped with timely information about the vaccination status of their communities,” the statement said.

The disclosure remains in effect until the end of September, but it can be modified or terminated, the executive order stated.

“Without this order, patients will continue to be frustrated that they are blocked from accessing their own vaccination records, and doctors and healthcare providers will be unable to easily lookup when and with what vaccine their patients were administered a COVID-19 vaccine,” Lamont said in the statement.

Several Connecticut hospitals, health centers, and health center associations expressed their support for the governor’s order.

Marna Borgstrom, CEO of Yale New Haven Health, said in the statement, “Vaccinations are the only safe and proven way to end this pandemic and giving all Connecticut residents access to their vaccination records will allow us all to return to doing all the things we love with those we love.”

Connecticut’s immunization information system was created in 1998 and has been recently updated to include vaccination against COVID-19, the disease caused by CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus.

In order to use the system, all health care providers, school nurses, and local health department users are required to sign a confidentiality agreement that needs to be renewed every two years, according to the statement. Access to the system is monitored and logged, and inappropriate activity can be investigated and addressed, the statement said.",p8jkfm,p8jkfm,XIIXOO,1,conservative

(1) Custody The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who—

(B) is deportable by reason of having com- mitted any offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title,

(C) is deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title on the basis of an offense for which the alien has been sentence to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year, or

(D) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title,

when the alien is released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation, and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.

However, it hasn't been said that they had ""COVID and *X*,"" in the news reports, it was just reported that ""cases of serious COVID infections and deaths are going UP, UP, UP."" Admittedly, it would be hard to separate the cases of people affected by COVID alone from those who had COVID with a contributing health issue, but it has been irritating (for me, at least) that the political, education, news and health communities have treated the disease *in itself* as life-altering or deadly and not one that could be bad to someone in good health but deadly to those with health issues. 

Don't get me wrong. For the most part, because of how badly one *could* be affected, especially if he or someone around him had other health issues,  I've been in agreement with the prophylactic procedures that have been in place and strongly encourage all who can to get immunized. However, I don't like it at all that it's been used as a political football for the past year-and-a-half and especially don't like that it's now being used as a cudgel against the rights of those in some personal groups (churches, parties, etc.) but somehow allowed for assemblies approved by the ""Beautiful People"" (Lollapalooza, Obama's birthday party, etc.)

Maybe a zpack and some instructions to take Tylenol for fever and if breathing gets worse come back to hospital. Why not as a preventative begin treating aggressively at time of diagnosis to PREVENT worsening of symptoms? And I am not necessarily believing that being vaccinated lessens the symptoms because this has not been what I have seen in all observations. It seemed w my friends and family they were equally sick whether vaccinated or not. My parents and niece are vaccinated were exposed to sick family members and did not get sick, and the one family member who went in hospital was unvaccinated but also was overweight, had smoked for years, and we believe has beginnings of congestive heart failure. Once in hospital they started treating her w antivirals and this special antibody mix. So after recovery the dr said to wait on getting vaccinated because she still should have those antibodies in her and he was reading her file to confirm she had the antibody treatment. Well my cousin ran out and got vaccinated because she panicked. So now they don’t know what that will do to the antibody treatment she had in the hospital. The friend who recently got covid was vaccinated and was able to stay out of hospital but was just as sick as my family members who had covid and had stayed out of the hospital (unlike my cousin). So I say all that to say if my cousin had got treatment w antiviral and antibodies at time of diagnosis she would probably never got in hospital. Also if vaxxed friend and unvaxxed friends and fam members who  got sick had gotten more advanced therapeutic treatment other than monitor symptoms and take Tylenol then they would also have seemingly gotten over it all much quicker. Since vaccinated and unvaccinated folks alike are experiencing illness why are most not doing what Gov DeSantis is doing and making the antibody treatment more widely available?

This source is reporting 5,743 COVID deaths in the U.S. in the last week, which would be about 300,000 deaths over the course of a year, which is more than 200,000 more than a very bad flu season. 

Is this source wrong?

EDIT: Hmm, this source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSmVxpV7qOk

puts the death count at 407 per week, which would be 24,507 per year, which isn't even a serious flu season. 

Does anyone have solid numbers on this?

EDIT 2: Here is CDC data

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html

>The current 7-day moving average of new deaths (492) has increased 21.0% compared with the previous 7-day moving average (407).

This would come out to 25,654 deaths per year (i.e., a non-severe flu season).

Am I missing something here?

EDIT 3: OK, it turns out I was missing something. A 7-day moving average is NOT a weekly average, but a daily average. 

>A moving average means that it takes the past days of numbers, takes the average of those days, and plots it on the graph. For a 7-day moving average, it takes the last 7 days, adds them up, and divides it by 7.

https://www.georgiaruralhealth.org/blog/what-is-a-moving-average-and-why-is-it-useful/

Thus 492 times 365 is 179,580 deaths per year. 

Even so, however, this much lower than the figure of 5,743 in a week (i.e., 3,444).

And as for *severe* cases, the vaccine has been strong at prevention all along.""  One visualization:

> Israel started administering a third dose to 60 y/o and above on July 30

> By now, over half of this age group received the 3rd dose

How do they come to this conclusion?  I thought it was accepted that the virus had a 2 week incubation period before it shows symptoms?  That’s why we have to quarantine for 2 weeks to prove we don’t have the virus.

That means that anyone who gets the vaccine now won’t effect the data for 2 weeks, yet the number of cases has already been dropping since they started the booster shots, which itself means that the number of infections was already dropping 2 weeks BEFORE they started issuing booster shots…",p7ac7s,p7ac7s,theradiostarz,1,conservative

Unfortunately our options are limited.  Treatments that worked well on the bench top have flopped in the ICU.  IMHO plaquenil and ivermectin need more prophylactic study, but they're thoroughly unimpressive in sick patients.
Infectious disease doctors have had a gloomy outlook from the beginning.  Despite what the talking heads have been pushing, people who really understand coronaviruses expected frequent boosters and changes to the vaccine.
I expect COVID-19 to become endemic.  Much like influenza, vaccines will be out best defence against ICU admission, will require regular doses (Q6-12 months) with tweaks to the formulation, and will show high variability in efficacy.
The real questions are:
Will we get a real investigate into the origins of the virus?

If they believe the delta variant is spreading rapidly not because it evades the vaccine.. ... but because the response of one's immunity lessens over time after getting the vaccine. How was this determined?  

The first people who received the vaccine were the elderly and immune compromised individuals.  I have no doubt that these groups immune system would be less effective months later after the vaccine because they are apart of two groups that have immune issues!

h9b8358,1629220027.0,julianwolf,"What is right is sometimes unpopular. While vaccination is good in general, it is not right to coerce people into getting vaccinated. It is also wrong to force people to receive a vaccine with no long term human studies on efficacy or safety. Businesses and government officials need to fuck off and let people make their own health decisions,  however ill informed. Furthermore, both need to be completely transparent with the public so that the individual members of the public can each make a good decision about the COVID vaccines.

h9b82h4,1629220015.0,grimrigger,"I disagree with you.  Most conservatives do not think this vaccine should be mandated.  They may think you should get it, but they respect individual choice and understand that coronavirus risk factors vary significantly by age, where the risk/benefit analysis of taking a rushed and new technology vaccine is different to people of different ages/health.  

The latest data showing that the vaccines do not stop infections or transmission of the virus(literally there is zero efficacy in reducing infection if you look at latest data coming out of Israel), means that this stops becoming a public health issue and comes down to personal choice.  Whether someone gets the vaccine or not, it makes no difference to another person since they have an equal chance of contracting it from anyone, vaccinated or not.  The efficacy in reducing hospitalizations and severe illness is still there, meaning on a personal level people should consider taking it, but once again that is based on a person's individual risk assessment.  Personally, I don't think it makes sense for anyone under the age of 40 who is healthy to get the shot, but it is up to that person.

The only way this becomes a public health issue is if unvaccinated overwhelm the hospitals.  But seeing as how something like 80% of the 60+ demographic in this country is vaccinated and that demographic makes up the vast vast majority of hospitalizations, I doubt we will ever see the unvaccinated under 60s be the cause of overwhelmed hospitals.

h96i5zu,1629134261.0,justwanttolurk,"I am a flared user in this sub, so please consider that when reading these questions.  Looking to have an honest conversation.  Before I get to my questions I want to make 3 statements

1. I think the CDC and Fauci are corrupt and political.  I have no faith in CDC directives and pay no attention to what Fauci says.
2. 'Covid' has been politicized by the media and the left.  There is long term damage from these actions.  Data has been manipulated for political gains and power grabs.  An example of this is how we now talk about 'cases' when a year ago it was 'deaths'.  
3. There is a difference between Science and Scientists.  Fauci is an example of this.  Actual science should be trusted.  Scientists can be corrupt pawns.  They are not the same but are often conflated on purpose.  

Because of the above, it is almost an almost impossible mission for the medical community (doctors and nurses in the hospital, not assholes in a lab coat on TV) to try and get ahead of this and steer this in the right direction.  

With that out of the way my first question is: 

1. When you read data that the vaccines don't work, can you define what 'working' means in that context?     

Here is my understanding after a conversation with a doctor who works in the main hospital in my city is that by and large the people who are facing serious medical issues with Covid are those who are unvaccinated.  I assume they also have other risk factors like general health but that's the case with any disease.  Those who have been vaccinated, on the other hand, have very very very little risk of facing serious medical issues from Covid.  So in this, one could say that the vaccine 'doesn't work' because even with the vaccine you can still get Covid.  One could also say that the vaccine 'does' work because if you have it you see a massive reduction in risk.  

So context matters here.  The problem, as I see it, is rooted in the items I listed above there is not the credibility there for the people pushing the vaccine to make this distinction.  

My second question is somewhat related:

2. Do you feel those who refuse the vaccine should be placed on a lower ranking for access to some medical services that are in limited supply behind those who have been vaccinated?  

I am all about personal choice and personal responsibility.  This includes dealing with the fallout from your decisions.  I have a specific example with a [machine or process called ECMO](https://nyulangone.org/news/more-patients-coronavirus-successfully-recover-when-supported-heart-lung-bypass-machines#:~:text=Published%20online%20in%20The%20Annals,patients%20with%20severe%20COVID%2D19.)   This is a heart-lung bypass machine that pushes oxygen rich blood into the lungs is my understanding.  It's a very successful tool/method.  The challenge comes in its availability.  This same hospital in my major city only has 2 ECMO setups.  They have 4 machines but can only run two at a time because you need a backup for each.  Additionally, this requires a nurse for the patient and someone to monitor the machine 24/7.  It's very very intensive.  

So a hypothetical for you...  So with this limited resource, should someone who refused to get the vaccine be put behind someone who did get it if both need the machine?  What if the person who got the vaccine worked in the hospital and got Covid from treating others?  A doctor is forced to treat the person in front of them without bias.  But you and I are not doctors.  So we can give an opinion.  

Should personal choice come with consequences?  I think it should.",p5jbxx,h9690rc,,2,conservative

The get it or else mentality that's spreading now is just going to make people dig their heals in more.

This virus mutates really slowly, and it has a single-stranded genome. The flu has a genome with 4 segments as opposed to one. For these reasons, I think it'll go away like all other previous coronaviruses have, even if it takes a while to reach herd immunity.

Think of it like poker when it comes to mutations. The coronavirus is playing a stud game (where you're dealt the only cards you'll have for the whole hand) whereas the flu is playing a draw game. The coronavirus has to cheat and physically change what it says on the cards in order to get a new hand. The flu can change out a card here and there, and it's cheating more often by physically changing what it says on its cards more frequently.

Fortunately, I think the R0 value after vaccination is still much lower than it is without, so that would be reason to encourage more people to get vaccinated. We'd reach herd immunity more quickly, and fewer people would have to get infected. Couple fewer infections with reduced chances of dying after getting vaccinated, and it seems like most people should be on board.

The reason he hasn't been voted out is twofold. The first is he buys votes in classic Liberal fashion, the second is that our Conservatives are *so fucking incompetent* they make the GOP look like political rockstars.

Unfortunately the rampant vote buying is literally about to bankrupt the country which is why he's calling an election early. Our housing crisis makes California look cheap with the average house at over $1M, bread is $4+, milk is $5+. We are fuuucked.

In may I was arrested at a protest simply for using my speech to call the protest organizer a coward directly to his face because he chose to walk away from confronting government **barricades** at his protest location where he normally held his rallies.

Crude yes, but not illegal in the slightest.

The crown said and I quote ""Your rights are secondary to our laws"" and they are literally attempting to criminalize *projecting your voice to be heard at a rally* and *swearing in private conversations*.

When you couple that with the vaccine passports, the removal of the freedom of religion, the freedom of protest (my situation), gross police powers granted, interprovincial travel checkpoints, dehumanizing language (plague rat is VERY common now), and creation of a 2 class society (one pro authoritarianism, one pro-liberty)...

I'm not sure if that many people in Peru were vaccinated when this happened and also the primary vaccine they are using there is one made in China. 

As for how they measure the variants, they are able to determine what variant it is through sequencing the tests. This takes longer and is more expensive than just getting a positive or negative test result, so they determine prevalence through sampling instead. If 1,000 people test positive maybe you only sequence 100 random tests to determine which variant you are seeing.

Sometimes the mutation is less deadly, sometimes it’s more deadly, sometimes it’s more or less contagious… it’s basically the luck of the draw. The mutations are essentially why we the develop a new flu vaccine a few times a year… need to to keep up with the mutations.

The only way to prevent mutations is to prevent the virus from replicating. And the only way to do that is to keep people healthy and ensure that no one gets sick. That’s obviously impossible… so the real tactic is reduce the number of people that get sick and/or reduce the severity of the illness, which reduces the number of replications and lowers the chance of encountering a bad replication.

Fundamentally the goal so to slow down the number of replications using vaccines, which gives us enough time to update the vaccine against the new strain.

The reason why this virus is mutating so quickly is because it is so contagious and spreads so easily… which means it has more chances to replicate and therefore… more opportunity to mutate. This is why you got these health officials around the world that are trying to get people vaccinated before we get to the point where the virus mutates so much that the vaccines become ineffective.

Where this gets complicated is when you combine the scientific goal of reducing the number of replications with the individual rights we have in this country (and other countries) that allows people to skip vaccines if they are uncomfortable or feel they don’t need it.

Being ""novel"", current outcomes may be due just as much to genetics, as it is to health (i.e. co-morbidity factors).

What if the genes you were dealt at conception, largely determine the degree of susceptibility each individual has to this virus?  That individual outcome is largely based upon genetics.  That all those that have been asymptomatic were genetically predisposed to being asymptomatic.  And those that have had mild to moderate symptoms, where genetically predisposed to having mild to moderate symptoms.  And those that were predisposed to having severe symptoms to include death, were genetically predisposed to a higher probability of death?  That regardless of whether you've been vaccinated or not, your outcome will only change if your health is already in decline, and health issues that affect your immune system, cardiovascular system, and circulatory system inhibit your body's ability to respond to the viral infection.

If genetic predisposition is what is driving this, there would be no way of knowing this - initially.  But at some point you would begin to see outcomes that don't reflect the expectations of the vaccine, outcomes that don't match the clinical trial results.  You would start seeing regional variations, do to small regional variations in the gene pool in each region.  For example, differences between an island population versus most or all portions of Africa where there are extremely few people from the island population.  You would also see breakthrough cases progressively increase, until there was a relatively small difference between outcomes on vaccinated versus unvaccinated.

The only place where you would not see an eventual equaling between vaccinated and unvaccinated, would be those in poor health, where the compromised immune system response is slower to the point that the virus overruns their immune systems because the virus simply outpaces that individual's immune system to mount a sufficient antibody defense.

The two scary things about this, is that if genetic predisposition is driving this, that those that otherwise would have had asymptomatic and mild to moderate responses, have been subject to much more detrimental risks of developmental, physiological, psychological, economic and sociological harm than the virus posed.

The second, if they find that vaccination has very little impact on individual outcome due to genetic predisposition, do you really think they'll ever tell us?",p3ytei,p3ytei,Ahyesclearly,1,conservative

Please note I was married to an abusive drug addict so I have firsthand knowledge with addicts.

I think we should have needle exchange places all over the US. Reusing and sharing needles are a huge health risk. When drug addicts get sick, they will still go to the hospital. If they can't hold a job due to their addiction they will rely on welfare. If we lessen the possibility of sickness then reliance on welfare for sickness will also lower. 

We should also stop imprisoning nonviolent drug crimes. Instead, we should put our taxes to better use by setting up rehab centers and social programs designed for addicts. If we want to have these people get well this is a good way to go about it. 

In my opinion we should make drugs legal and tax the sales, but I understand why people are against that.

Lastly, it seems like we treat addicts as if they're lower than dogs and deserve punishment. This does not help and reduces the possibility that they can return to society and be productive members. Punishment and justice would be better served for only violent drug crimes. These are human beings who deserve our pity, and our sympathy.",p3scnx,h8toaz5,TheShakinBacon,2,conservative

I said it yesterday, I got fucked up by the new variant and was down for a full three weeks and I am still recovering. However, we (those of us in my home who got hit hard) were told to stay home and use OTC drugs. SpO2 of 90 and no sleep or food for a week and almost accidentally OD’d Tylenol since they are 500s now, not 325s. Fever of over 104 for most of it (Tylenol controlled). Cracked a rib from coughing so much/hard. We could not move but a few feet to do anything. It took all we could muster to go outside to sit in the sun for a few minutes. I could go on, it was bad news, but the point is this. I did not go to the hospital, although we maybe should have, and my body created the antibodies necessary to beat this one. I guess it was a miracle that I recovered then, since it’s being shoved down my throat that there is no such thing as natural immunity. I will say this, my vaxxed oldest child (only one in my home) fared very well, although he did have some tiredness/weakness. My youngest, not vaxxed, was a bit worse off than the oldest, but had a minor cough and tiredness with very few other issues. Basically, a cold for home.

If this continues, they will make the boosters mandatory, otherwise even the vaccinated people with 2 or 3 doses will not be allowed into gyms and stores if they don't get their 4th shot. Where does the slippery slope end? We don't 'mandate' the flu vaccine which is exactly how it should be. If you want it, go for it. But don't mandate it, because then it will set a dangerous precedent of mandating a booster every 6-12 months which could lead... god knows where. we don't even have long term safety data on 2 covid shots. Imagine the long term effects of having 4-5 shots total. What will be the long term effects? Could be anything at that point but of course any rise we see in cancer or heart disease or myocarditis will just be blamed on anything else with people spouting the same old phrase they've always spouted to protect big pharma, ""cOrElAtIoN dOeSnT eQuAl cAuSaTiOn"".

h8sygny,1628874373.0,dealmbl25,"Let me preface this so I don't get immediately downvoted.  I voted for Trump.  I think mask and vaccine mandates are BS.  The country should have never locked down, generally, we should have gone with the Swedish Model where we protected the older folks and let everyone do what they want.  And finally cloth and surgical masks do next to nothing so it makes no sense to mandate them, especially for children which are at little to no risk from COVID.  It's all a political charade.

Now, having said that and establishing I'm not just a fanboy of one particular side, the Vaccine DOES actually work.  It protects fairly well against COVID breakthroughs (particularly Moderna) and even if you do get a breakthrough your case will likely peak at a cold or a mild flu.  People should choose to get the vaccine but I honestly don't care if you don't.  It's a free country.

I get the annoyance about this but from a medical standpoint this isn't a surprise.  We have seasonal flu shots, it only makes sense that the COVID Vaccine was going to become somewhat seasonal with these viruses having the tendency to mutate/T-Cell immunity having a ""shelf-life"".  I'll likely get the booster shot on a yearly basis (I'm in the medical field so it'll probably get mandated for me sooner rather than later anyway) and I'll encourage my family to do that same.  I've got small kids and will likely hesitate to give them the vaccine if it is ever approved for their age range (2 and 4) simply because they are at such low risk from severe illness from it in the first place and I'll like to see how it effects the younguns that do get it for a couple years before I give it to my kids.

Hopefully that gives a well-rounded rebuttal to the knee-jerk ""This is all BS!!"" point of view.  I get that the CDC and Biden Admin don't have your trust, and quite frankly they shouldn't, but Big Pharma (contrary to what people may think) actually do have their act together even if you think they're a bunch of dirty, cash-grabbing, Capitalists.

> “No, screw your freedom,” Schwarzenegger continued. “Because with freedom comes obligations and responsibilities. We cannot just say, ‘I have the right to do X, Y and Z.’ When you affect other people, that is when it gets serious.”

He's kind of right. You do have freedom and the right to do a lot of things, but in taking advantage of those freedoms you cannot infringe on the rights of others. The pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. 

Unfortunately though, whether or not something infringes on the rights of someone else often becomes a subjective argument that may be true in some cases, but false in others. Often highly politicized to the point where you cannot even trust the ""facts"". 

The simple truth is that any mask ***can*** reduce the risk of catching or spreading the virus and other illnesses. Even if that is only to ensure that persons mouth is always covered when they cough/sneeze.  However, that is highly dependent on proper use, cleaning the mask regularly, handling it properly, and the fact some particles are small enough to go right through a mask anyway- which is when you need an N95 or other type of mask. There are also other risks, such as reduced airflow and a buildup of harmful bacteria on a mask when not properly cleaned. Also, the general inconvenience. . .So, it isn't hard to get into a argument based on subjective viewpoints on whether or not a mask is worth wearing. 

Then again, sometimes you have to say ""wear you damn mask"", ""eat your vegetables"", etc. . .treat people like children because they cannot exercise a modicum of common sense.

There are also a lot of ""maybes"" and ""probablies"" in the article, especially when it comes to speculating about a virus that might possibly mutate to be more transmissible and more deadly even for vaccinated people. Maybe that will happen; maybe the virus will evolve out of existence in the years to come. No one knows. One thing scientists do seem to know now is that  SARS-CoV-2 doesn't mutate as readily as the flu virus. It's handicapped by the necessity of its particular spike protein. 

What just happened in the UK looks good for the future in the U.S. We'll have a surge and then it will drop off once the virus hits a wall with previously infected and vaccinated people.

Basically, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines contain a manmade sort of instruction manual (mRNA) and the J&J vaccine is just an old school piece of the virus. The synthetic mRNA and J&J's piece of the virus can't hijack your cells and replicate the virus in your body. 

What it does do is get your body to recognize the worst parts of SARS-CoV-2, so when you do come in contact with the real virus you've had some training and your immune system can mobilize an efficient and effective response to attack the virus and kill it.  That's why it takes 2 weeks after your shot to be protected. It takes time for your body to learn how to fight Covid.

Then he states, ""ask yourself, why is a vaccine that is supposedly so effective having a breakout in the middle of Summer, when respiratory viruses don’t do that.""

He seems to be right in the first statement, but I was left confused by his follow-up. 

As I understand it, vaccines aren't silver bullets that kill viruses, and they don't supercharge your immune system. They only train your immune system to better handle specific viruses effectively and efficiently. If you're vaccinated, and you're exposed, there's a chance you're going to get sick (>45%), but so far the stats show you won't end up in the hospital or dead (>95%). In other words, he's right when he says no vaccine will keep you from getting infected. So why does he question about the so-called ""breakouts?""

Let’s talk masks, since there’s some readily available data on that. All we have is state level statistics, so we’ll use that. The null hypothesis is that masks have no effect on the community impact of covid. 

Based on the numbers available we can see 2 things clearly - there is no correlation between masks and fatalities, and there is a slight correlation between masks and case load. Now, consider what correlation and lack thereof tells us. Correlation does not imply causation, however a lack of correlation does imply lack of causation. Therefore we can say there is no causal link between masks and fatalities (or a reduction thereof). Now, for case load, demographics including comorbidity prevalence, climate, and geography including population density are all also correlated with case load. So what does this mean for masks? It means that we can’t causally link them with the reduction in cases without more information on the other correlated factors. 

This also means that without further evidence and information, we cannot reject the null hypothesis\*. Because we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we should be asking for evidence from anyone who wants to put a mask mandate in place. 

\*and this doesn’t account for vaccines either, but the data showed similar correlations without the vaccine",p1tc0d,h8fmvwa,unfortunatelybig,2,conservative

However, if you look at this by age cohort, and look at the >50s, you see that there were 389 deaths out of 21472 infections for double-vaccinated (death rate of 1.8%), and 204 deaths from 3440 infections for unvaccinated people (death rate of 5.9%) - 3.3 times higher for unvaccinated.

h8gb79w,1628627130.0,cdazzo1,"You're not completely wrong, but there's another side to this.  I've seen it suspected that the durability of the vaccine is similar to the flu vaccine which is ballpark 6 months with maybe some lingering benefit for a total of a year or so.  Hence the booster shot talk over the past few weeks.

Assuming that is all true (and I'm sure we're still waiting on data and studies to confirm), it's only been about 8 months since release of the vaccine which makes more or less 2 months since reduced efficacy started on those who were first vaccinated.  Figure our data lags 1-2 weeks behind and we'd only be seeing severe breakthrough cases in a very small percentage of the vaccinated at this point.  Some of my timelines may be off but I think I'm close enough for the point to remain.

So if you want statistics, we're still kind of waiting.  The same can be said about risks of the vaccine.  I don't think you can conclusively say what those risks are yet.  We do have some idea.  We know it's not instant death.  But we also don't know if the risk is greater than the reward for all categories and demographics of patients.

The VAERS reporting has been blown way out of proportion by some.  There are large anomalies, but we also have a situation with a vaccine being given to a tremendous number of people in highly unusual circumstances.  I'd be suspect if there weren't anomalies in the numbers.  But I still think this needs to be investigated before we just recommend vaccines and boosters for everyone across the board, particularly children and those with natural immunity.  For example, all of these people who have died in the VAERS system, is this abnormal when controlled for the number of vaccinations as well as for the age of the patients?

>Coerced lockdowns and masks must be the only viable solutions, progressives told us for over a year,  because their “experts” like Anthony Fauci said that was what “the science” demanded.  

>And yet, there proudly stands Sweden, openly mocking the leftists’ most sacred orthodoxy of the moment. 

>But Sweden’s relative success isn’t limited its medical outcomes.  Not only did Sweden avoid the ravages of the virus in terms of death rates, but its citizens are unquestionably happier and more readily poised for the future.  According to a new Pew Research poll, 86 percent of Swedes say the current economic situation is good, which dwarfs the assessments of Brits (44 percent), Canadians (49 percent), or the French (26 percent).  Sweden’s citizens are most likely, among a host of world nations, to say that their government did a “good job” in handling the 2020 pandemic.  Sweden’s 86 percent positive outlook on the economy is nearly reversed in America, with 71 percent saying that the current economic outlook is bad.

>If you remember, the initial proposition of the lockdowners and maskers took the form of infectious slogans like “flatten the curve” and “slow the spread” and, perhaps most insidiously, “we’re all in this together.”  When some, like Dr. David Katz, argued in favor of targeted mitigation for the minority segment of older and vulnerable Americans while allowing the rest of us to go about our lives, we were told that it was simply impossible to think that this small demographic could be protected from the virus.  However, when the government claimed that it could protect everyone from the virus, that was somehow achievable. 

>So, the smart guys in government decided that the best way to do that was to send healthy college kids home to live with mom and dad, while grandma and grandpa were living upstairs.  Last May, a pre-disgrace Andrew Cuomo was shocked to find that two-thirds of hospitalizations in New York were people who got the virus at home.  “We thought they were taking public transportation,” he said, “but actually, no, because these people were literally at home.”  He said this before hectoring the public about individual choices, saying that “much of this comes down to individual choice,” because “everything closed down, government did everything it could.”

>No one ever explained exactly how lockdowns and masks would make it any safer for us when we emerged from our homes to live normal lives again.  One has to imagine that many Americans simply accepted that COVID might magically disappear if people just masked harder and stayed more isolated from each other for some undefined longer period of time -- which, when you think about it, is no less stupid and unscientific than accepting that a trip to a crowded Costco or a Black Lives Matter protest was safe, while going to church or a Trump rally would be a death sentence. 

>But perhaps the questions about how masks and lockdowns could make us safer in the long run never required substantiation because they’re not as important as the other question we already answered early in 2020.  And that is, who gets to decide when we can live “normal” lives again?

>Cuomo’s hectoring of New Yorkers last year is instructive.  First, citizens were told that they, as individuals, either aren’t capable of making the choices to keep themselves safe, or that they can’t be trusted to do so.  Then, when the government enacted policies which simultaneously made people less free and less safe, it was still New Yorkers’ bad individual choices that were blamed.  The answer to this, of course, was to further limit the choices that people have in responding to the risks of COVID in their own lives while giving the government more power to intercede.  This, in most American states and cities, included the doubling down on the bad policies already enacted and the creation of even more intrusive policies.

>“Shutting down society,” as Sweden’s Dr. Carlson correctly reminds us, has unequivocally proven to be a failure in eliminating “disease transmission,” though it has proven to be a very successful means of creating corporate monopolies, expanding government authority and influence, and spreading economic and social malaise in the places that employ them. 

>So why are these two things assumed to be the default reactions to any negative news around COVID?  Who benefits from dehumanizing the individual in favor of promoting collectivist signs of conformity, and who benefits from creating corporate monopolies, or expanding government authority and influence while stirring economic and social malaise to promote greater dependence upon government institutions?

>You know the answer those questions, just as you know who benefits from mass mail-in voting, ballot harvesting, and a prohibition on photo identification requirements in voting.  ",p1qagb,p1qagb,StonedPorcupine,1,conservative

h8fuuog,1628620180.0,Zeius,"Steve Cox's statement is terrible. No defending that.

But what's going on with the sensationalism in this article?

First, Cox is an independent that, after gaining only 4.8% of the vote, lost in the 2020 primary. The general election went to Young Kim, a republican, with 50.6% of the vote. [(source)](https://ballotpedia.org/Steve_Cox_(California)) 

Second, what's with the argument in the article that COVID is ""only the 7th leading cause of death"" and therefore shouldn't be taken seriously? Cause #8 is diabetes, is that not deadly enough to take seriously?

Third, their own source ([link](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/covid-19-continues-to-be-a-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s-in-june-2021/)) shows that COVID's 7th place position is only recent. From their own source: ""COVID-19 was the [third leading cause of death](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/the-pandemics-effect-on-the-widening-gap-in-mortality-rate-between-the-u-s-and-peer-countries/) across all of 2020, but in December 2020 and early 2021, the illness surged and briefly became the [number one](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/covid-19-is-the-number-one-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s-in-early-2021/) leading cause of death in the U.S., far surpassing even cancer and heart disease deaths in those months."" Even if you agree with the premise that the reduced fatality rate of COVID should yield less restrictions, you have to take practicality into consideration as it's impossible for policy to react that quickly to data. 

Cox shouldn't be saying the things he's saying, but blowing up his importance as a ""Californian candidate"" without addressing that he's from a very bipartisan district, then cherry picking the agreeable parts of their sources just to push their own narrative, is bad journalism.",p1oqzk,p1oqzk,triggernaut,1,conservative
