hblp947,1630783533.0,MikeGinnyMD,"Abstract

The successful development of several COVID-19 vaccines has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality in regions of the world where the vaccines have been deployed. However, in the wake of the emergence of viral variants, able to evade vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies, real world vaccine efficacy has begun to show differences across the mRNA platforms, suggesting that subtle variation in immune responses induced by the BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 vaccines may provide differential protection. Given our emerging appreciation for the importance of additional antibody functions, beyond neutralization, here we profiled the postboost binding and functional capacity of the humoral response induced by the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in a cohort of hospital staff. Both vaccines induced robust humoral immune responses to WT SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs. However, differences emerged across epitopespecific responses, with higher RBD- and NTD-specific IgA, as well as functional antibodies (ADNP and ADNK) in mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. Additionally, RBD-specific antibody depletion highlighted the different roles of non-RBD-specific antibody effector function induced across the mRNA vaccines, providing novel insights into potential differences in protective immunity generated across these vaccines in the setting of newly emerging VOCs.",pfndwf,pfndwf,icloudbug,1,covid19

hb4ks45,1630455969.0,dailysunshineKO,"From the article: 

If you are feeling frustrated by people who are refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, the answer isn’t to try and scare them or make them feel worse. It is to provide facts with kindness. We are all trying to do what we think is right, to listen to the people we think are telling the truth, to keep our children as safe as possible. Our actual goals are probably very similar; we just have different ideas as to how we can reach them. Perhaps by listening to each other more, we can find a middle ground and actually be able to move forward.  

I went from “anti-vaxxer” to getting the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccinating my children. I found peace in my decision, and that’s what I hope everyone can find. Whatever decision you make, make it an informed one that you can feel comfortable with; make it a decision based on facts and evidence from real sources. 


Many people have been asking me what really changed my mind when it came to getting the vaccine. Was it a certain person? Was it a piece of particular information? 
What changed my mind is that I ran out of reasons to NOT get it. 


When I was saying I wouldn’t be getting the vaccine, I had a list of reasons why. Things like fear of side effects, worrying how effective it was, questioning if natural herd immunity was better, and so on. One by one, those reasons were removed from my list as I learned more.  


Here are some of the Instagram accounts that helped educate me on vaccines and viruses: @jessicamalatyrivera, @epidemiologistkat, @your_local_epidemiologist, @sciencewhizliz, @science.sam, @unambiguousscience and @unbiasedscipod.  


I decided that it made the most sense to trust the people who were experts in vaccines and viruses (I know, duh — but I’d been convinced that these experts were all biased or bought out; not true). I quickly learned that some of what I had heard about vaccines and coronaviruses before from nonexperts simply was not accurate — it didn’t even scientifically make any sense! These are the people who gained my trust and ultimately changed my mind. ",pfihjg,pfihjg,dailysunshineKO,1,covid19

> The functional relevance of pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a subject of intense debate. Here, we show that human endemic coronavirus (HCoV)-reactive and SARS-CoV-2-cross-reactive CD4+ T cells are ubiquitous but decrease with age. We identified a universal immunodominant coronavirus-specific spike peptide (S816-830) and demonstrate that pre-existing spike- and S816-830-reactive T cells were recruited into immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their frequency correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1-IgG antibodies. Spike-cross-reactive T cells were also activated after primary BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccination displaying kinetics similar to secondary immune responses. Our results highlight the functional contribution of pre-existing spike-cross-reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Cross-reactive immunity may account for the unexpectedly rapid induction of immunity following primary SARS-CoV-2 immunization and the high rate of asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 disease courses.",pfdcsq,pfdcsq,enterpriseF-love,1,covid19

Vaccines against virus and antibiotics against bacteria are not alike. While both exert selection pressure on the pathogen, an antibiotic does this statically. The bacteria will change as a response, but the antibiotic cannot change to respond in kind. Vaccine-mediated immunity, on the other hand, is very versatile and dynamic. It can shift it's antibody type and quantity in response to changes in the virus, creating an immune response that is always custom-tailored.

Abstract

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has seen an unprecedented amount of rapidly generated genome data. These data have revealed the emergence of lineages with mutations associated to transmissibility and antigenicity, known as variants of concern (VOCs). A striking aspect of VOCs is that many of them involve an unusually large number of defining mutations. Current phylogenetic estimates of the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its genome accrues around 2 mutations per month. However, VOCs can have around 15 defining mutations and it is hypothesised that they emerged over the course of a few months, implying that they must have evolved faster for a period of time. We analysed genome sequence data from the GISAID database to assess whether the emergence of VOCs can be attributed to changes in the evolutionary rate of the virus and whether this pattern can be detected at a phylogenetic level using genome data. We fit a range of molecular clock models and assessed their statistical fit. Our analyses indicate that the emergence of VOCs is driven by an episodic increase in the evolutionary rate of around 4-fold the background phylogenetic rate estimate that may have lasted several weeks or months. These results underscore the importance of monitoring the molecular evolution of the virus as a means of understanding the circumstances under which VOCs may emerge.",pfb6ev,pfb6ev,icloudbug,1,covid19

hb4huni,1630454615.0,minuteman_d,">**Conclusions**  
The emergence and introduction of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants like the Delta variant are projected to lead to a substantial resurgence of COVID-19 in the US and are already causing increasing cases in every state across the country. The high variant transmissibility scenarios, which appear to more accurately represent the characteristics of the Delta variant, both in transmissibility and in current case trajectories, projected a significant national resurgence with substantial variation in magnitude across states. Resurgences are expected to be more pronounced in low-vaccination jurisdictions. The  
projections indicate that even with substantial vaccination coverage, the increased transmissibility of new variants like Delta can continue to challenge our ability to control this pandemic. Renewed efforts to increase vaccination coverage are critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with low natural immunity and lower current vaccination, in addition to re-instituting control measures like indoor masking when needed. Multi-model ensemble efforts such as the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub are particularly well-suited to provide disease projections to inform the pandemic response under changing epidemiological and behavioral situations.

So, basically, the Delta variant is going to grow more quickly in areas with low vaccination rates (and low acquired immunity) - as one might expect. Also, it makes it clear that we need more people to get vaccinated.

hb4iz4w,1630455129.0,yaolilylu,"""Background:

Patients with chronic inflammatory disease (CID) treated with immunosuppressive medications have increased risk for severe COVID-19. Although mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provides protection in immunocompetent persons, immunogenicity in immunosuppressed patients with CID is unclear.

Results:

Most of the 133 participants with CID (88.7%) and all 53 immunocompetent participants developed antibodies in response to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, although some with CID developed numerically lower titers of anti-S IgG. Anti-S IgG antibody titers after vaccination were lower in participants with CID receiving glucocorticoids (n = 17) than in those not receiving them; the geometric mean of anti-S IgG antibodies was 357 (95% CI, 96 to 1324) for participants receiving prednisone versus 2190 (CI, 1598 to 3002) for those not receiving it. Anti-S IgG antibody titers were also lower in those receiving B-cell depletion therapy (BCDT) (n = 10). Measures of immunogenicity differed numerically between those who were and those who were not receiving antimetabolites (n = 48), tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (n = 39), and Janus kinase inhibitors (n = 11); however, 95% CIs were wide and overlapped. Neutralization titers seemed generally consistent with anti-S IgG results. Results were not adjusted for differences in baseline clinical factors, including other immunosuppressant therapies.""",pfafck,pfafck,Peeecee7896,1,covid19

>Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a lethal respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the end of 2019 and has since spread aggressively across the globe. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular infection by coronaviruses is therefore of utmost importance. A critical stage in infection is the fusion between viral and host membranes. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and the influence of calcium and cholesterol, in this fusion process. Structural information from specular neutron reflectometry and small angle neutron scattering, complemented by dynamics information from quasi-elastic and spin-echo neutron spectroscopy, revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the Spike fusion domain. Calcium drives the N-terminal of the Spike fusion domain to fully cross the host plasma membrane. Removing calcium however re-orients the protein to the lipid leaflet in contact with the virus, leading to significant changes in lipid fluidity and rigidity. In conjunction with other regions of the fusion domain which are also positioned to bridge and dehydrate viral and host membranes, the molecular events leading to cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 are proposed.


> **SIGNIFICANCE** We have recreated here important elements of the critical membrane fusion mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by simplifying the system down to its core elements, amenable to experimental analysis by neutron scattering. Neutrons are well suited for the study of protein – membrane interactions under physiological conditions, since they allow structural and dynamics characterization at room temperature. Our results revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the viral Spike fusion domain and thereby provide a potential calcium-dependent cell entry mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. In particular, calcium drives the protein’s N-terminal to harpoon through the host membrane, while removing calcium re-orients the protein so that it is able to bridge and dehydrate lipid membranes, facilitating their fusion.",pf8wip,pf8wip,icloudbug,1,covid19

At the time of this writing, August 2021, potential emergence of vaccine escape variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a grave global concern. The interface between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the host receptor (ACE2) overlap with the binding site of principal neutralizing antibodies (NAb), limiting the repertoire of viable mutations. Nonetheless, variants with multiple mutations in the RBD have rose to dominance. Non-additive, epistatic relationships among RBD mutations are apparent, and assessing the impact of such epistasis on the mutational landscape is crucial. Epistasis can substantially increase the risk of vaccine escape and cannot be completely characterized through the study of the wild type (WT) alone. We employed protein structure modeling using Rosetta to compare the effects of all single mutants at the RBD-NAb and RBD-ACE2 interfaces for the WT, Gamma (417T, 484K, 501Y), and Delta variants (452R, 478K). Overall, epistasis at the RBD surface appears to be limited and the effects of most multiple mutations are additive. Epistasis at the Delta variant interface weakly stabilizes NAb interaction relative to ACE2, whereas in the Gamma variant, epistasis more substantially destabilizes NAb interaction. These results suggest that the repertoire of potential escape mutations for the Delta variant is not substantially different from that of the WT, whereas Gamma poses a moderately greater risk for enhanced vaccine escape. Thus, the modest ensemble of mutations relative to the WT shown to reduce vaccine efficacy might constitute the majority of all possible escape mutations.",pf3tcn,pf3tcn,icloudbug,1,covid19

Secondly, we used the S-Fuse live-virus neutralization assay to assess the sensitivity of infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants to HCW sera before and after vaccination, several months after primary infection.

Main data on antibody kinetics:

 > From Month 7, anti-RBD antibodies stabilize at a level that neutralizes infectious variants D614G and B.1.1.7, but less B.1.351, suggesting that most COVID-19 positive patients may be protected from reinfection by the former variants. [This study also shows the level of anti-RBD IgG titers was reached by all vaccinated person's regardless of pre-vaccination IgG levels and type of vaccine]

[during 1 year timeslice there were 69 infections amongst the 916 negative HCW, and one asymptomatic reinfection amongst the 393 previously positive]

haytv2c,1630352449.0,Peeecee7896,"Abstract:

>Severe COVID-19 is characterized by extensive pulmonary complications, to which host immune responses are believed to play a role. As the major arm of innate immunity, neutrophils are one of the first cells recruited to the site of infection where their excessive activation can contribute to lung pathology. Low-density granulocytes (LDGs) are circulating neutrophils, whose numbers increase in some autoimmune diseases and cancer, but are poorly characterized in acute viral infections. Using flow cytometry, we detected a significant increase of LDGs in the blood of acute COVID-19 patients, compared to healthy controls. Based on their surface marker expression, COVID-19-related LDGs exhibit four different populations, which display distinctive stages of granulocytic development and most likely reflect emergency myelopoiesis. Moreover, COVID-19 LDGs show a link with an elevated recruitment and activation of neutrophils. Functional assays demonstrated the immunosuppressive capacities of these cells, which might contribute to impaired lymphocyte responses during acute disease. Taken together, our data confirms a significant granulocyte activation during COVID-19 and suggests that granulocytes of lower density play a role in disease progression.",pepgks,pepgks,Peeecee7896,1,covid19

hb1o9r6,1630410593.0,TempestuousTeapot,"Conclusions  
In summary, we show that patients with low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in their respiratory tract are less likely to mount a systemic antibody response. Although we cannot formally exclude false-positive RT-PCR results in some participants, PCR contamination is highly unlikely as an explanation for our findings (Appendix). We also show that clinical illness does not guarantee seroconversion and that laboratories with highly sensitive RT-PCR assays are more likely to detect serologic nonresponders. These results provide an explanation for the puzzling variability of seroconversion in different cohorts.  
  
The fact that a considerable fraction of RT-PCR positive persons fail to seroconvert has practical implications. Such persons remain undetected in seroprevalence studies, including in vaccine studies that assess protection from asymptomatic infection by measuring antibodies to antigens not included in the vaccine. Seroconverters and nonseroconverters will probably also respond differently to vaccination. Recent studies revealed that seropositive persons have a heightened antibody response after the first, but not the second, dose of an mRNA vaccine, suggesting that a single dose is sufficient (11–13; Samanovic et al., unpub. data, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251311External Link). Serologic nonresponders might not exhibit a similarly heightened anamnestic response, but resemble SARS-CoV-2 naive persons, as was observed for 1 previously infected vaccinee who never seroconverted (14). Finally, RT-PCR positive persons who experienced COVID-19 symptoms might be less inclined to seek vaccination, believing they are protected, but our results caution against this assumption.",peol8k,peol8k,icloudbug,1,covid19

> Can intramuscular vaccination induce an immune response that protects against not only disease (COVID19), but viral infection and transmission of SARSCoV2 in the local mucosa? In a new preprint by  we found that saliva may be KEY. Secreted *mucosal* antibodies  protect from infection or spread of infection in the mucosa of the nose and mouth  *Circulating* antibodies prevent systemic infection and disease. Which antibodies do we make after vaccination?

> We measured antibodies against the SARSCoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in *plasma* & *saliva* from convalescent or vaccinated individuals and tested their neutralizing potential using a replication competent rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2. While individuals with a history of COVID19 had detectable RBD-specific antibodies and neutralizing ability in their *saliva and plasma,* one of our most surprising findings was the striking differences in *salivary* antibodies between vaccines. 

> Individuals who had received 1 dose of Ad26.COV2.S (J&J) produced high levels of *circulating* antibodies against RBD, as expected. However, these same individuals had very low levels of antibodies in their *saliva,* which also lacked the ability to neutralize the virus. Individuals who had received mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) in 1 or 2 doses also developed robust RBD-specific antibodies with neutralizing ability in the *plasma* but unexpectedly ALSO in the *saliva

> The highest levels of *salivary* neutralizing activity were in participants who received 2 doses of mRNA vaccine AND made high levels of anti-RBD IgA in their saliva (comparable to convalescent individuals). Only cohort to reach statistical significance at stringent FRNT70. A seperate team evaluated these same *saliva* samples and found that their IgA had secretory chain, demonstrating that these are dimeric IgA (found in mucosal tissues)

> Most importantly, our study shows that all 3 vaccines granted emergency use authorization (EUA) in the US induce robust antibody response in the *plasma* protecting against severe disease and death. ALL 3 vaccines w/ EUA approval in the US can induce immune responses in the *saliva,* albeit at varying levels. Not having sufficient levels of mucosal antibodies at the site of infection  may put people at risk for infection & transmission in the upper airway.

> Could there be a novel mechanism of the mRNA vehicle to permeate the mucosal immune compartment and induce a mucosal immune response? This has not historically been seen with intramuscular vaccination. Or is it just leakage of antibodies from the blood into the saliva, where super high antibody levels in the blood then also lead to more significant levels in the saliva?

> Our study has several limitations, notably, this data is PRE-DELTA. The sample sizes are small. We tried to capture as many of the limitations as we could think of in the text. Together, our 2 studies provide extremely pertinent new information on the impact of different vaccine platforms, dosing, and schedules on mucosal immunity to SARSCoV2, and compare different vaccination strategies that have been implemented in North America.",pensaa,pensaa,icloudbug,1,covid19

Just do a double-blind study with 1000 people each and give one group a physiological salt solution as a nasal spray and the other the same with Pfizer/Moderna mRNA in it. In the worst case it does nothing in both groups or about the same as a booster shot.

Notwithstanding limitations in accuracy and resolution of the data available from public sources, we pinpoint significant trends exploiting information in curves and shapes with Functional Data Analysis techniques. These depict two starkly different epidemics; an “exponential” one unfolding in Lombardia and the worst hit areas of the north, and a milder, “flat(tened)” one in the rest of the country—including Veneto, where cases appeared concurrently with Lombardia but aggressive testing was implemented early on. We find that mobility and positivity can predict COVID-19 mortality, also when controlling for relevant covariates.

All military members were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second dose of an appropriately spaced 2-dose series. All patients had significantly elevated cardiac troponin levels. Among 8 patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging within the acute phase of illness, all had findings consistent with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis.

Meanwhile, there have been numerous studies that the Delta variant has resulted in a higher rate of hospitalization than the original Alpha strain.  Those studies show anywhere between 4 and 6% of those who contract Delta will end up in the ER/hospital within 2 weeks (and skewing younger and healthier than Alpha).  And 95-98% of those will be unvaccinated.  Mortality among hospitalized patients has ranged from 10-25% depending on the time period age group, etc. (it was higher earlier when hospitals were not prepared and patients were much older, so overall its not as high but is worse for younger/healthier than last year).

So let's take those 436,000 fully vaccinated military men, and  pretend they were not vaccinated.  Now not all of those would definitely be infected with COVID or even the Delta variant.  So let's assume that 100,000 ultimately get the Delta variant of COVID, which is realistic given the rate of spread and trends since early 2020.  Let's assume a 4% rate of hospitalization, and a 10% mortality of hospitalized patients.  That results in 4,000 hospitilzations and 400 deaths.  Even if that is 10x too high, 400 hospitilzations and 40 deaths as a super conservative and unrealistic estimate is way worse than 19 reported myocarditis cases that were generally not severe.",pejwvb,pejwvb,Judas1984,1,covid19

1. The genetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 goes very neatly back to the Wuhan strain. This evolved in one place. Genetic evidence is ironclad.

2. Serology and epidemic behavior support that the entire population was, in fact, naive and susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. People aren't positive for it, or for anything close to it, until they get infected. Poor early serology tests gave a false impression here with excessive false positives in naive population and/or cross reaction. No serious study has found anything weird. 

3. It is not possible for a respiratory virus to circulate efficiently in humans without being able to spread exponentially. A more or less undetectably benign virus (itself quite a claim) would (a) spread worldwide quickly as no measures would be used to stop it (see 2009 H1N1), (b) have evolutionary offspring, and (c) if it was SARS-CoV-2,  should not possibly be able to spot evolve so much as to be unrecognizable to prior immune systems. Alpha and Delta, both significant mutants, are fully recognized if you have had original wild type; Alpha is also fully covered by the vaccine targeting Wuhan. And there is a very big difference between being naive to this thing or having prior immunity. Even where the vaccine can't stop a Delta infection, almost no one dies of it despite it being apparently significantly more severe.

China is the same country with plenty of bat coronaviruses and is where SARS originated from in 2002. This theory would be much more believable if the outbreak would have started in almost any other country.,pebw8t,pebw8t,vitorgrs,1,covid19
hayuzfp,1630352911.0,large_pp_smol_brain,"So, I see a lot of discussion here about false positives. I am drawn to this part of this article:

> The COVID-19 pandemic is presumptively originated in October-November 2019 in China, since symptom onset of the first identified patient occurred on 1 December 2019 [2]. Nevertheless, American and European data suggest earlier, undetected, and relatively sustained SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Indeed, in May 2019, **in England, 2.97% (3/101) blood doors had high SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG (two also had IgA and IgM suggesting recent infection), that did not react with other coronaviruses [3].** In November 2019, in France, 1.89% (42/2,218) individuals from a healthy cohort had high SARS-CoV-2 S1-reactive IgG levels [4]. In Italy, 2.22% (1/45) blood donors had high levels of IgG/IgM against the nucleocapsid protein in December 2019 [5], **while 14.20% (23/162) individuals from a healthy cohort had detectable anti-RBD IgG/IgM in September 2019 [6]**. In December 2019, in California, Oregon and Washington, 2.04% (39/1,912) blood donors had high S-reactive pan-Ig levels [7]. ***Importantly, specificity of antibody tests used in these studies was very high.***

There’s some interesting stuff here at least worth digging more into. I will definitely be reading citation [6] as it appears to be an outlier. A 15% false positive rate seems almost impossibly high, given the standards of testing required to get a COVID antibody test approved in most parts of the world. I have been following the data on serology surveys since the beginning of the pandemic, and many early samples came up with numbers less than 1%, only hitting mid single digits after the first wave, so 15% false positive rate would mean a terrible test or a botched procedure, and the other numbers are a little suspect as well... 2-3% false positive rates do **not** match up with the clinical testing data I have seen on EUA’d COVID antibody tests. I will search for data to confirm this but I am pretty sure almost all of those tests have specificities over 99%, so seeing 2-3% positives is just... hard to explain. These tests generally are required to undergo testing that shows that they do **not** cross-react with other coronavirus antibodies, as far as I am aware.",pebw8t,pebw8t,vitorgrs,1,covid19

Abstract

Aims
The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic requiring global responses. The objective of this paper is to identify the common factors of COVID-19 cases and deaths among the 50 most affected countries.

Methods
We performed Ordinary least squares among a wide range of socio-economic, environmental, climatic and health indicators to explain the number of cases and deaths.

Results
The findings are: (i) obesity is the only significant global denominator for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths; (ii) the percentage of the population over the age of 65 and number of hospital beds per 1000 population inversely correlated to mortality from COVID-19.

Conclusions
Obesity increases vulnerability to COVID-19 infections and mortality. Global awareness of obesity and social investment in health infrastructure are pre-requisite for a pandemic adaptive future. However, the study is limited to cross-sectional data of April 17, 2020",pebjw0,pebjw0,QuantumFork,1,covid19

Objective To assess the association between covid-19 vaccines and risk of thrombocytopenia and thromboembolic events in England among adults.

Design Self-controlled case series study using national data on covid-19 vaccination and hospital admissions.

Setting Patient level data were obtained for approximately 30 million people vaccinated in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021. Electronic health records were linked with death data from the Office for National Statistics, SARS-CoV-2 positive test data, and hospital admission data from the United Kingdom’s health service (NHS).

Participants 29 121 633 people were vaccinated with first doses (19 608 008 with Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and 9 513 625 with Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2 mRNA)) and 1 758 095 people had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. People aged ≥16 years who had first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and any outcome of interest were included in the study.

Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were hospital admission or death associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism within 28 days of three exposures: first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine; first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; and a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Secondary outcomes were subsets of the primary outcomes: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events.

Results The study found increased risk of thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (incidence rate ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.47 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (5.27, 4.34 to 6.40 at 8-14 days); increased risk of venous thromboembolism after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.10, 1.02 to 1.18 at 8-14 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.86, 12.76 to 15.05 at 8-14 days); and increased risk of arterial thromboembolism after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.06, 1.01 to 1.10 at 15-21 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.02, 1.82 to 2.24 at 15-21 days). Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

Conclusion Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.",pe9896,pe9896,afk05,1,covid19

havcwje,1630283819.0,afk05,"Abstract

Background: Recently emerged mutations can be attributed to increased transmissibility of the B.1.617 and B.1.36 Indian delta-variants of SARS-CoV-2, most notably substitutions L452R/E484Q and N440K, respectively, which occur in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) fusion glycoprotein.

Objective: We aimed to assess the effects of mutations L452R/E484Q and N440K (as well as the previously studied mutation E484K, present in variants B.1.351 and P.1) on the affinity of RBD for ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 main receptor. We also aimed to assess the ability of antibodies induced by natural infection or by immunization with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to recognize the mutated versions of the RBD, as well as blocking the interaction RBD-ACE2, an important surrogate readout for virus neutralisation.

Methods: To this end, we produced recombinant wild-type RBD, as well as RBD containing each of the mutations L452R/E484Q, N440K, or E484K (the latest present in variants of concern B.1.351 and P.1), as well as the ectodomain of ACE2. Using Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), we measured the binding affinity of RBD for ACE2 and the ability of sera from COVID-19-convalescent donors or subjects immunised with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to block this interaction, a readout of virus neutralisation. Finally, we correlated these results with total anti-RBD IgG titres measured from the same sera by direct ELISA.

Results: The binding assays showed L452R/E484Q double-mutant RBD to interact with ACE2 with higher affinity (KD = 4.6 nM) than wild-type (KD = 21.3 nM) or single-mutants N440K (KD = 9.9 nM) and E484K (KD = 19.7 nM). Meanwhile, the anti-RBD IgG titration resulted in lower recognition of mutants E484K and L452R/E484Q by infection-induced antibodies, whereas only mutant E484K was recognized less by antibodies induced by vaccination. More interestingly, sera from convalescent as well as immunized subjects showed reduced ability to block the interaction between ACE2 and RBD mutants E484K and L452R/E484Q, as shown by the inhibition assays.

Conclusion: Our data suggest that the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617, as well as the better-studied variants B.1.351 and P.1 (all containing a mutation at position E484) display increased transmissibility both due their higher affinity for the cell receptor ACE2 and their ability to partially bypass immunity generated against the wild-type virus. For variant B.1.36 (with a point mutation at position N440), only increased affinity seems to play a role.",pe7f4e,pe7f4e,afk05,1,covid19

1) the data by age shows a greatly higher incidence of stroke and heart attack following vaccination vs following COVID-19. 


2) in the month before infection, people on average were at higher risk of clotting than in the month prior to vaccination.

A comprehensive analysis of the humoral immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential in understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis and developing antibody-based diagnostics and therapy. In this work, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 104 serum samples from 49 critical COVID-19 patients using a peptide-based SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. Our data show that the binding epitopes of IgM and IgG antibodies differ across SARS-CoV-2 proteins and even within the same protein. Moreover, most IgM and IgG epitopes are located within nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are critical in inactivating the host’s innate immune response and enabling SARS-CoV-2 replication, transcription, and polyprotein processing. IgM antibodies are associated with a good prognosis and target nsp3 and nsp5 proteases, whereas IgG antibodies are associated with high mortality and target structural proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike, ORF3a). The epitopes targeted by antibodies in patients with a high mortality rate were further validated using an independent serum cohort (n = 56) and using global correlation mapping analysis with the clinical variables that are associated with COVID-19 severity. Our data provide fundamental insight into humoral immunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic epitopes identified in this work could also help direct antibody-based COVID-19 treatment and triage patients.",pe7aiq,pe7aiq,afk05,1,covid19

Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific target-based activities—rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.",pe754c,pe754c,afk05,1,covid19

>**Background**: On July 30, 2021, a third (booster) dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was approved in Israel for individuals 60 years or older who had been fully vaccinated (i.e., received two doses) at least five months previously. Here, we estimate the reduction in relative risk for confirmed infection and severe COVID-19 provided by the booster dose.

>**Methods**: 1,144,690 individuals aged 60y and older who were eligible for a booster dose were followed between July 30 and August 22, 2021. We defined dynamic cohorts where individuals initially belong to the ‘non-booster’ cohort, leave it when receiving the booster dose and join the ‘booster’ cohort 12 days later. Rates of infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes per person-days at risk were compared between the cohorts using Poisson regression, adjusting for possible confounding factors.

>**Results**: Twelve days or more after the booster dose we found an 11.4-fold (95% CI: [10.0, 12.9]) decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection, and a >10-fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness. Under a conservative sensitivity analysis, we find ≈5-fold protection against confirmed infection.

>**Conclusions**: In conjunction with safety reports, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a third vaccine dose in both reducing transmission and severe disease and indicates the great potential of curtailing the Delta variant resurgence by administering booster shots.",pe020d,pe020d,RufusSG,1,covid19

I suspect you already understand this and your question was rhetorical, expressing a moral belief about what *ought* to be done. But I figure I'll spell it out anyways in case there's anyone who still needs to have their idealistic illusions about human nature shattered:

Almost nobody is basing policy decisions on a utilitarian analysis of how to maximize human welfare on a global scale. Leaders and citizens of a country will nearly always prefer a policy that prioritizes the welfare of their own citizens above all else.

Taking the US as an example, if you surveyed people in the United States asking them which of the following options they prefer:

1. Save the lives of a 1,000 people in the US
2. Save the lives of 2,000 people in Mongolia

The vast majority of people would pick option 1, even though it's not the choice that maximizes human welfare. And these people vote, so elected leaders will make similar choices.",pe020d,haundsi,blazerz,2,covid19

If there was a strong belief that the vaccinated didn't have enough virus present to spread, the calculation would be different. 

Basically it's easier to get the 70% of the population that is vaccinated to get a third dose than convince the 30% that isn't to get a first dose of J&J (or two doses of an mRNA vaccine).",pe020d,haundsi,blazerz,2,covid19

We used an ELISA method that measure IgG against anti-Spike 1 and a chemiluminescence immunoassays that measure IgG anti-RBD. In the patients, antibodies concentrations tend to decline after a few months with both methods, but persist relatively high up to nearly a year after symptoms. In vaccinated subjects, antibodies were already detectable after the first dose, but after the booster they show a significant increase. However, the decrease is rapid, given that after 3 months after the second vaccination they are reduced to less than a quarter.

hauy6zx,1630276696.0,large_pp_smol_brain,“Similar” is such an nondescript and subjective word. Almost all research I have seen places the protection against reinfection as higher than protection from vaccination (but obviously this does not even remotely imply that it’s safer to get infected than to get vaccinated),pdunwt,hasz36s,leidogbei,2,covid19
hatcz8t,1630252256.0,harryyplopper,"I’ve given some serious thought to natural immunity and I don't think this provides an ""Anti-Vax"" argument at all and shouldn't be considered taboo. I believe that (1) there’s a pro-vax argument to be made by acknowledging it in media reports and (2) lack of acknowledgement makes the vaccine’s efficacy look like it wanes faster than reality. Based on the Israeli study (not yet peer-reviewed), natural immunity appears better than vaccination but this is NOT an anti-vax argument like everyone says.

My rationale is that current efficacy stats compare unvaccinated to vaccinated, which has suggested that the vaccine is losing its efficacy (ie lower efficacy against the delta variant). However, if natural immunity really is as good or better than the vaccine, then the vaccine isn't LOSING effectiveness (or at least not as quickly as the publicly discussed numbers suggest), rather the proportion of unvaccinated becoming immune is RISING. The real measure of efficacy reported to the public should thus compare (i) double vaxxed to (ii) non-immune (ie unvaxxed AND previously infected). Because the number of non-immune must logically be less than the number of unvaxxed, comparisons to unvaxxed alone can only understate the vaccine's effectiveness and understate the death rate to the unprotected. Note that this pertains to media reporting (which is leading to political resistance to certain ideas), not peer-reviewed studies. 

For example, if 50% of the unvaxxed were previously infected, then (hypothetically) (i) a reported death rate of 1% for unvaxxed would mean a 2% for non-immune (ii) a 80% vaccine efficacy relative to unvaxxed would mean 90% efficacy against non-immune.

This has several implications:

(1) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity means that danger to the unprotected is UNDERSTATED. If you are unvaxxed and not immune then the virus is MORE DANGEROUS than the stats suggest, meaning that people may feel falsely secure by not getting vaccinated. I'll bet that the majority in the hospital are both unvaxxed and non-immune

(2) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity makes comparisons between vaxxed and unvaxxed underplay the vaccine's efficacy, because the vaccine is actually more effective against NON-IMMUNITY.

(3) It’s possible that the vaccine’s waning efficacy is overstated

(4) failure to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity will erode public trust, converting more people into conspiracy theorists because they feel they're being lied to

(5) I optimistically predict that the vaccine protection against the delta variant is closer to the prior variants than the official numbers suggest

I have sensed that the media are extremely reluctant to acknowledge this out of fear of causing vaccine hesitancy, however I believe that is a mistake for the reasons outlined above. Also, anecdotally, I shared that Israeli study with a couple of friends and they got FURIOUS, accusing me (a double vaxxed individual) of being an anti-vaxxer. This is leading me to believe that life-and-death public health decisions are being made influenced by emotion (fear and hatred) rather than facts, statistics and logic; for obvious reasons I find that horrifying.",pdunwt,pdunwt,icloudbug,1,covid19
hath2ym,1630253941.0,playthev,"The only people getting upset about the strength of natural immunity are the people who are more driven by political ideology than science. If you are pro vaccination, you should really be caring more about the level of immunity in the population than just whether someone took a vaccine or not. This is good news for everyone.

As to whether vaccine effectiveness estimates dropping directly because of increased immunity in the unvaccinated population, well there's certainly at least a small contribution from this effect. However as you have shown yourself, it takes 50% of the unvaccinated population to get infected (and then infection to provide 100% immunity from reinfection) for a vaccine with 90% efficacy to have its effectiveness drop to 80%. But we are seeing effectiveness well below 80% in some studies. It would take 80% infection rate in the unvaccinated for a 90% efficacy vaccine to drop effectiveness to 50%. So pretty clear that increasing immunity in the unvaccinated alone can't explain the waning protection against infection from vaccination.

Another thing to note is Pfizer vaccine efficacy seems to drop faster than AZ vaccine efficacy, suggesting that there's something intrinsic about vaccine induced immunity that is waning with time. In any case the vaccines are still doing their main job which is protection from serious illness. Remember this isn't really waning with time at anywhere near the same rate.",pdunwt,hatcz8t,harryyplopper,2,covid19

haw36yn,1630297247.0,SlowerThanLightSpeed,"I believe that there is a foundational flaw in the analysis behind the conclusions in the results section of the pre-printed study linked in the OP.  
  
pre-print pdf: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1)  
  
I'd describe that foundational flaw two ways, first through an analogy:  
  
A 98%-off coupon is not twice as good as a 96%-off coupon... it's 1.02 times better.  
  
The pre-print makes the analogous mistake of comparing a 4% final price to a 2% final price when it instead should be comparing savings rates (reductions in infection rates, symptomatic infection rates, and rates of hospitalizations from infections).  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
What they should do is retrospectively determine the rate of new infections, symptomatic infections, and infections that led to hospitalization amongst naively-immune individuals over that same period of time (again matching age-sub-groups etc).  
  
From there, they could readily determine the ""savings"" from each type of immunity, and then directly compare those ""savings.""  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
My own estimate of naively-immune individuals' outcomes over the same time period suggests that 540 would've gotten infected, 457 would've had symptomatic infections, 28 would've been hospitalized, and 3 or 4 would've died. (based on overall infection rates in the US, I assumed that 3.33% of a naively-immune population of 16,214 people would've gotten infected).  
  
Based on those assumptions, it would seem that convalescent immunity outperformed vaccine-induced immunity at the following rates:  
  
1.73 times better for avoiding any infection (not 13),  
\- convalescent immunity prevented 521 infections, vaccine 302  
1.69 times better for avoiding symptomatic infections (not 27),  
\- convalescent immunity prevented 449 symptomatic infections, vaccine 266  
1.35 times better for avoiding hospitalizations (not 8).  
\- convalescent immunity prevented 28 hospitalizations, vaccine 20  
  
  
  
(really wish I had that control data of naively-immune individuals over the same June-Aug time period... I'm sure the original authors could get it, and then do even fancier analytics than my simple arithmetic)  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Regardless, using numbers from [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html), to end up with 16,214 previously infected participants, 16,317 had to get infected, out of which approximately:

harsl5e,1630215097.0,smoothvibe,"Abstract:  
Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a safety concern for vaccine strategies. In a recent publication, Li et al. (Cell 184 :4203–4219, 2021) have reported that infection-enhancing antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein facilitate virus infection in vitro, but not in vivo. However, this study was performed with the original Wuhan/D614G strain. Since the Covid-19 pandemic is now dominated with Delta variants, we analyzed the interaction of facilitating antibodies with the NTD of these variants. Using molecular modeling approaches, we show that enhancing antibodies have a higher affinity for Delta variants than for Wuhan/D614G NTDs. We show that enhancing antibodies reinforce the binding of the spike trimer to the host cell membrane by clamping the NTD to lipid raft microdomains. This stabilizing mechanism may facilitate the conformational change that induces the demasking of the receptor binding domain. As the NTD is also targeted by neutralizing antibodies, our data suggest that the balance between neutralizing and facilitating antibodies in vaccinated individuals is in favor of neutralization for the original Wuhan/D614G strain. However, in the case of the Delta variant, neutralizing antibodies have a decreased affinity for the spike protein, whereas facilitating antibodies display a strikingly increased affinity. Thus, ADE may be a concern for people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors). Under these circumstances, second generation vaccines with spike protein formulations lacking structurally-conserved ADE-related epitopes should be considered.

Note: This paper was commented by Derek Lowe two weeks ago. What I find troubling is that he and others in the scientific community (including participants and probably mods here) don't stay objective but rather seem to express their  wish, that this just can not happen. This is not what science should be. He made good points in his blog, but his intro just makes his objective arguments less powerful.

Regarding this papers findings there already is another paper supporting that exact theory, showing that infection enhancing antibodies bind to the changed NTD: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.22.457114v1.full.pdf](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.22.457114v1.full.pdf)

And yes, the title of the paper I just posted seems a bit off, because when ADE comes into action it won't spare recovered people as well, thus ADE is no vaccine-only effect. It could serve anti-vaxxers to support their ideology, so I really don't understand why some scientists use sensationalist headlines (probably just to get more attention).",pdpequ,pdpequ,smoothvibe,1,covid19

hasfwib,1630234562.0,JayCroghan,"**Conclusion**

&nbsp;

>Overall, current data are largely reassuring as they do not strongly suggest that the presence of an immune-mediated inflammatory disease or most medications associated with their treatment (except for glucocorticoids and rituximab) universally puts patients at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or the development of severe COVID-19. The higher risk of severe COVID-19 reported in some studies20,  57 might be attributed to the accompanying cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic comorbidities associated with these diseases, which have been shown to be the main determinants of poor COVID-19 outcomes.2,  20 Notably, increased rates of hospitalisation in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease were not associated with increased rates of death.28 Consequently, particular attention might be focused on controlling comorbidities and to prioritising vaccination according to comorbidities.
Although abundant evidence shows that glucocorticoid use leads to increased risk of infection and COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease, cytokine inhibitors do not seem to interfere with antiviral response or viral clearance; no marked differences in COVID-19 susceptibility have emerged between patients and the general population. On the contrary, protective effects have been reported for cytokine inhibitors, particularly TNF inhibitors.21,  26,  57 These effects could be due to better control of the underlying disease, lower use of glucocorticoids, beneficial effects of cytokine blockade on preventing the development of hyperinflammatory states, or a combination thereof. In view of these findings, current recommendations from rheumatologists, dermatologists, and gastroenterologists unanimously recommend continuation of cytokine inhibitors during the pandemic.98,  99,  100,  101,  102 Despite the fact that the continuation of cytokine inhibitors during COVID-19 infection has not been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in several reported cases, patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if asymptomatic, are currently advised to suspend such drugs.98,  99,  100,  101,  102
The findings discussed in this Review seem to be consistent across high-income countries with diverse health systems and in patients with different immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (table) but little evidence is available on COVID-19 in patients in low-income countries.103 In many of these countries, insufficient testing capacity and already strained health-care systems have resulted in barriers to access of medical care. For patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, this issue adds to the challenge of receiving adequate care during the pandemic, especially in rural areas with poor infrastructure. An increase in the risk of relapse and in glucocorticoid use could come as a consequence of the pandemic in low-resource settings, which could potentially expose the patient population to worse COVID-19 outcomes by comparison with their counterparts in high-income countries.
Altogether, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and cytokine inhibitors do not seem to affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19. Conversely, broad spectrum immune suppression (eg, glucocorticoids, B-cell depleting drugs) is linked to worse outcomes, suggesting that the action of modern treatments (ie, cytokine inhibitors) are confined to dampening specific immune pathways without impairing host defence. As control of inflammation is crucial to the overall health of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, the benefits of cytokine inhibitors seem to outweigh the risks, and these drugs can be and have been continued during this pandemic, although patients should still adhere to preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, data from patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases undergoing vaccination suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are effective, despite immunomodulatory treatment, except for B-cell depleting therapies, methotrexate, or TNF blockers. Individuals receiving these therapies might require testing to assess whether adequate immune responses are elicited after vaccination and whether booster vaccination is required to generate sufficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in these individuals.",pdlahe,pdlahe,IrishVixen,1,covid19

When you're looking for something incredibly tiny, but that has a signature sequence, you need to boost the level of that thing in order to detect it. If there's enough of a thing to cause detection, it will cross the detection ""threshold"". We can refer to the boosting of the level of the thing as ""amplifying"", and each time we do an amplification, it's a ""cycle"". CT values are ""Cycle Threshold"" values.

It's basically the number of times, or cycles, that a sample needs to be ""amplified"" before it shows a result. Kinda. The average number of times it takes to amplify the sample before it crosses the threshold is the CT value.  Again... ""kinda"".

So if you get a result after amplifying once or twice, there's a lot of the thing in the sample.

If you have to amplify 35 times, there's probably almost nothing there.

So counterintuitively, low CT values have more of the thing, and higher CT values have less.  So if I get a Covid PCR test, and my CT value is 48.1, I don't have Covid.  If my CT value is 16.8, I definitely have Covid. If my CT value is 3.1, something is seriously wrong.",pdeqgt,har0pse,wookieb23,2,covid19

>Abstract

>Thrombosis affecting the pulmonary and systemic vasculature is common during severe COVID-19 and causes adverse outcomes. Although thrombosis likely results from inflammatory activation of vascular cells, the mediators of thrombosis remain unconfirmed. In a cross-sectional cohort of 36 severe COVID-19 patients, we show that markedly increased plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels were accompanied by a partial reduction in the VWF regulatory protease ADAMTS13. In all patients we find this VWF/ADAMTS13 imbalance to be associated with persistence of ultra-high-molecular-weight (UHMW) VWF multimers that are highly thrombogenic in some disease settings. Incubation of plasma samples from patients with severe COVID-19 with recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) substantially reduced the abnormally high VWF activity, reduced overall multimer size and depleted UHMW VWF multimers in a time and concentration dependent manner. Our data implicate disruption of normal VWF/ADAMTS13 homeostasis in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and indicate that this can be reversed ex vivo by correction of low plasma ADAMTS13 levels. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for rADAMTS13 in helping restore haemostatic balance in COVID-19 patients.",pdejck,pdejck,tozalo,1,covid19

haolcl5,1630159179.0,Reddie_Mercury,"**Abstract**While evidence exists supporting the potential for aerosol transmission ofSARS-CoV-2, the infectious dose by inhalation remains unknown. In the present study, the probability of infection following inhalation ofSARS-CoV-2 was dose-dependent in a nonhuman primate model of inhalational COVID-19. The median infectious dose, assessed by seroconversion, was 52 TCID50 (95% CI: 23–363 TCID50), and was significantly lower than the median dose for fever (256 TCID50, 95% CI: 102–603 TCID50), resulting in a group of animals that developed an immune response post-exposure but did not develop fever or other clinical signs ofinfection. In a subset of these animals, virus was detected in nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, suggesting that infected animals without signs of disease are able to shed virus and may be infectious, which is consistent with reports of asymptomatic spread inhuman cases of COVID-19. These results suggest that differences in exposure dose may be a factor influencing disease presentation in humans, and reinforce the importance of public health measures that limit exposure dose, such as social distancing, masking, and increased ventilation. The dose-response data provided by this study are important to inform disease transmission and hazard modeling, and, ultimately, mitigation strategies. Additionally, these data will be useful to inform dose selection in future studies examining the efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines against inhalational COVID-19, and as a baseline in healthy, young adult animals for assessment of the importance of other factors, such as age, comorbidities, and viral variant, on the infectious dose and disease presentation.",pd9vbs,pd9vbs,Epistaxis,1,covid19

Could this be a reason why it seems to be so much safer to participate in outdoor activities? Are we probably still being exposed but in very low doses?

Introduction A worldwide vaccination campaign is underway to bring an end to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, its success relies heavily on the actual willingness of individuals to get vaccinated. Social media platforms such as Twitter may prove to be a valuable source of information on the attitudes and sentiment towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination that can be tracked almost instantaneously.

Materials and methods The Twitter academic Application Programming Interface was used to retrieve all English-language tweets mentioning AstraZeneca/Oxford, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in 4 months from 1 December 2020 to 31 March 2021. Sentiment analysis was performed using the AFINN lexicon to calculate the daily average sentiment of tweets which was evaluated longitudinally and comparatively for each vaccine throughout the 4 months.

Results A total of 701 891 tweets have been retrieved and included in the daily sentiment analysis. The sentiment regarding Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appeared positive and stable throughout the 4 months, with no significant differences in sentiment between the months. In contrast, the sentiment regarding the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine seems to be decreasing over time, with a significant decrease when comparing December with March (p<0.0000000001, mean difference=−0.746, 95% CI=−0.915 to −0.577).

Conclusion Lexicon-based Twitter sentiment analysis is a valuable and easily implemented tool to track the sentiment regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. It is worrisome that the sentiment regarding the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine appears to be turning negative over time, as this may boost hesitancy rates towards this specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",pcqjmt,pcqjmt,,1,covid19

SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest have been associated with increased transmissibility, neutralization resistance and disease severity. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance world-wide has improved our ability to rapidly identify such variants. Here we report the identification of a potential variant of interest assigned to the PANGO lineage C.1.2. This lineage was first identified in May 2021 and evolved from C.1, one of the lineages that dominated the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South Africa and was last detected in January 2021. C.1.2 has since been detected across the majority of the provinces in South Africa and in seven other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania. 

The emergence of C.1.2 was associated with an increased substitution rate, as was previously observed with the emergence of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern (VOCs). C.1.2 contains multiple substitutions (R190S, D215G, E484K, N501Y, H655Y and T859N) and deletions (Y144del, L242-A243del) within the spike protein, which have been observed in other VOCs and are associated with increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization sensitivity. Of greater concern is the accumulation of additional mutations (C136F, Y449H and N679K) which are also likely to impact neutralization sensitivity or furin cleavage and therefore replicative fitness. While the phenotypic characteristics and epidemiology of C.1.2 are being defined, it is important to highlight this lineage given its concerning constellations of mutations.",pcpbef,pcpbef,,1,covid19

Abstract

>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but potentially life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy, characterized by disseminated thrombus formation in the microvasculature, causing severe organ failure. Immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) is occasionally described after vaccination, especially against viral agents. We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a de novo iTTP after exposure to the mRNA-based anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine produced by Pfizer-BioNTech. She presented with increased bruising and petechiae starting 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of the anti-COVID-19 vaccine. Laboratory data revealed a severe ADAMTS13-deficiency in combination with a very high autoantibody titer against ADAMTS13. She was successfully treated with plasma exchange, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of iTTP after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in a previously TTP-naïve patient.",pcnbjm,pcnbjm,tozalo,1,covid19

>Aims: SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to endothelial and vascular dysfunction. We investigated alterations of arterial stiffness, endothelial coronary and myocardial function markers four months after COVID-19 infection.


>Methods and results: In a case-control prospective study, we included 70 patients four months after COVID-19 infection, 70 age- and sex-matched untreated hypertensive patients (positive control) and 70 healthy individuals. We measured a) perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced endothelial glycocalyx thickness), b) flow-mediated dilation (FMD), c) coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) by Doppler echocardiography d) pulse wave velocity (PWV) e) global left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular longitudinal strain (GLS) and f) malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress marker, thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) as endothelial biomarkers. COVID-19 patients had similar CFR and FMD with hypertensives (2.48±0.41 vs 2.58±0.88, p=0.562, 5.86±2.82% vs 5.80±2.07%, p=0.872 respectively) but lower values than controls (3.42±0.65, p=0.0135, 9.06±2.11%, p=0.002 respectively). Compared to controls, both COVID-19 and hypertensives had greater PBR5-25 (2.07±0.15μm and 2.07±0.26μm p=0.8 vs 1.89±0.17μm, p=0.001), higher PWV (PWVc-f 12.09±2.50 vs 11.92±2.94, p=0.7 vs 10.04±1.80m/sec, p=0.036) and impaired LV and RV GLS (-19.50 ±2.56% vs -19.23±2.67%, p=0.864 vs -21.98±1.51%, p=0.020 and -16.99±3.17% vs -18.63±3.20%, p=0.002 vs -20.51±2,.28%, p<0.001). MDA and thrombomodulin were higher in COVID-19 patients than both hypertensives and controls (10.67±2.75 vs 1.76± 0.30, p=0.003 vs 1.01±0.50nmole/L, p=0.001 and 3716.63±188.36 vs 3114.46±179.18, p=0.017 vs 2590.02±156.51pg/ml, p<0.001). Residual cardiovascular symptoms at 4 months were associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction markers.

one treatment approach appears to be to increase nitric oxide in the body, however a body that is ill may not be able to increase NO on its own through normal pathways, which leads to supplementation via nitrates, but since supplementation in itself is not a cure, it leads to ""nitrate tolerance"" and the body dials down its own production even further

As far as glycocalyx is concerned, it seems to be pretty sensitive.
Smoking, meals, and other things seem to modify the state.


So, I think it's possible to help our body keep the control of the glycocalyx state, at least in some cases.


Drinking coffee, for example, is known to be aggravating factor for some LongCovid cases. So, Avoiding it would help.


Similarly, there should be something that would help the body to regain the stability and tolerances. But it might be different for each person, depending on the auto-antibodies, and other factors.

It compares the risk of clotting in people in the month post vaccination, to the risk of clotting post symptomatic infection *in vaccinated people*.

It does not assess the risk of clotting post infection for unvaccinated people. It's possible, even if unlikely, that clot risk is higher post infection for vaccinated people compared to post infection for unvaccinated people.


Secondly, Table 2 seems to show that the adverse outcomes (stroke, heart attack etc) for people over 70 is vastly higher post vaccination compared to post infection, i.e. up to 60% higher.

I cannot see any mention of ""breakthrough infections"" or a specification that vaccination has to have occurred prior to infection. I was assuming that they could have occurred in either order.

They refer to vaccination and infection as primary and secondary events, but that doesn't always imply chronological order.

Whichever way I look at it though, it seems problematic. 

If either can occur first, then only those who survived an unvaccinated infection could be included in the data set. All the fatal infections included would be breakthrough infections which would seem like source of bias. Alternatively, if you are right and all the data is on outcomes of breakthrough infections surely this would be a massive confound?

I already had queries about the data being from from people prioritised for vaccination. The priority groups were mainly based on covid vulnerability with a smaller percentage prioritised due to profession. It seems relative risks from covid infection versus vaccination are being extrapolated from people who were identified as most vulnerable to serious covid outcomes. Vaccination outcomes are then compared to those who also became an identified case within a four month period. Serious cases are much more likely to be identified and are not representative of all infections. I cannot understand how this data is generalisable.",pcjk5c,hamhi7b,floor-pi,2,covid19

The main thing that jumps out to me is the primary endpoint: hs-CRP. Is this an appropriate endpoint? It's a standard, non-specific indicator of systemic inflammation, and it's certainly elevated in patients with COVID - but that doesn't mean it's necessarily a good thing to measure, because plenty of things raise/decrease CRP without actually affecting what happens to the patient (ie, clinical outcomes), which is what we care about. We know high doses of EPA can reduce systemic inflammation markers, but they often don't do a huge amount in terms of acute clinical outcomes. You choose an endpoint like this if you want a near-guaranteed 'positive' study.

Then we look at symptom changes, and the big issue here is that the trial was unblinded and not placebo controlled. Assessment of symptoms like ""do you have loss of taste/smell, yes or no?"" is, obviously, subjective.

Finally, there appears to be no prospective statistical analysis plan, allowing the statisticians (who work for the company providing the product) to do whatever analyses they like to show efficacy. Vague wording for endpoints in the NCT record (eg: ""Change in hs-CRP levels from the randomization visit (Day 1) to the Day 14 visit [ Time Frame: 14 days ]"") reflects this.",pcibiv,pcibiv,LeatherCombination3,1,covid19

•
hs-CRP was significantly reduced within the icosapent ethyl cohort (P-value=0.011)
•
Total symptom prevalence was significantly reduced in treatment versus usual care

Summary

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Therapeutic options to reduce symptoms, inflammatory response, or disease progression are limited. This randomized open-label trial enrolled 100 ambulatory patients with symptomatic COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada. Results indicate that icosapent ethyl (8g daily for 3 days followed by 4g daily for 11 days) significantly reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and improved symptomatology compared with patients assigned to usual care. Specifically, the primary biomarker endpoint, change in hs-CRP, was significantly reduced by 25% among treated patients (-0.5mg/L, IQR[-6.9,0.4], within-group P=0.011). Conversely, a non-significant 5.6% reduction was observed among usual care patients (-0.1mg/L, IQR[-3.2,1.7], within-group P=0.51). An unadjusted between-group primary biomarker analysis was non-significant (P=0.082). Overall, this report provides evidence of an early anti-inflammatory effect of icosapent ethyl in a modest sample, including an initial well-tolerated loading dose, in symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients.

>The  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  can  evolve  to  clinical  manifestations  resembling  
systemic   autoimmune   diseases,   with   the   presence   of   autoantibodies   that   are   still   poorly   
characterized. To address this issue, we performed a cross-sectional study of 246 individuals to 
determine  whether  autoantibodies  targeting  G  protein-coupled  receptors  (GPCRs)  and  renin-
angiotensin  system  (RAS)-related  molecules  were  associated  with  COVID-19-related  clinical  
outcomes.  Moderate  and  severe  patients  exhibited  the  highest  autoantibody  levels,  relative  to  
both  healthy  controls  and  patients  with  mild  COVID-19  symptoms.  Random  Forest,  a  machine  
learning  model,  ranked  anti-GPCR  autoantibodies  targeting  downstream  molecules  in  the  RAS  
signaling  pathway  such  as  the  angiotensin  II  type  1  and  Mas  receptor,  and  the  chemokine  
receptor  CXCR3  as  the  three  strongest  predictors  of  severe  disease.  Moreover,  while  the  
autoantibody  network  signatures  were  relatively  conserved  in  patients  with  mild  COVID-19  
compared  to  healthy  controls,  they  were  disrupted  in  moderate  and  most  perturbed  in  severe  
patients.  Our  data  indicate  that  the  relationship  between  autoantibodies  targeting  GPCRs  and  
RAS-related  molecules  associates  with  the  clinical  severity  of  COVID-19,  suggesting  novel  
molecular pathways for therapeutic interventions.",pchjag,pchjag,icloudbug,1,covid19

Objective To estimate the effectiveness of mRNA covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospital admission or death).

Design Test negative design study.

Setting Ontario, Canada between 14 December 2020 and 19 April 2021.

Participants 324 033 community dwelling people aged ≥16 years who had symptoms of covid-19 and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.

Interventions BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine.

Main outcome measures Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and hospital admissions and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression was adjusted for personal and clinical characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine receipt to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes.

Results Of 324 033 people with symptoms, 53 270 (16.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 272 (6.6%) received at least one dose of vaccine. Among participants who tested positive, 2479 (4.7%) were admitted to hospital or died. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection observed ≥14 days after one dose was 60% (95% confidence interval 57% to 64%), increasing from 48% (41% to 54%) at 14-20 days after one dose to 71% (63% to 78%) at 35-41 days. Vaccine effectiveness observed ≥7 days after two doses was 91% (89% to 93%). Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission or death observed ≥14 days after one dose was 70% (60% to 77%), increasing from 62% (44% to 75%) at 14-20 days to 91% (73% to 97%) at ≥35 days, whereas vaccine effectiveness observed ≥7 days after two doses was 98% (88% to 100%). For adults aged ≥70 years, vaccine effectiveness estimates were observed to be lower for intervals shortly after one dose but were comparable to those for younger people for all intervals after 28 days. After two doses, high vaccine effectiveness was observed against variants with the E484K mutation.

Conclusions Two doses of mRNA covid-19 vaccines were observed to be highly effective against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness of one dose was observed to be lower, particularly for older adults shortly after the first dose.",pchc52,pchc52,Doctor-Chronos,1,covid19

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-, full Spike- and RBD -IgG seropositivity rates and IgG levels at six months were significantly lower in the elderly compared to HCW. Serum neutralization of Delta VOC measured by pseudovirus neutralisation test was detectable in **43/71** (60.6%, 95%CI: 48.9-71.1) in the elderly cohort compared to **79/83** in the HCW cohort (95.2%, 95%CI: 88.3-98.1) at six months post vaccination. Consistent with the overall lower antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-S1 T cell reactivity was reduced in the elderly compared to HCW (261.6 mIU/ml, IQR:141.5-828.6 vs 1198.0 mIU/ml, IQR: 593.9-2533.6, p<0.0001).

Over the past several decades, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have progressed from a scepticism-inducing idea to clinical reality. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic catalysed the most rapid vaccine development in history, with mRNA vaccines at the forefront of those efforts. Although it is now clear that mRNA vaccines can rapidly and safely protect patients from infectious disease, additional research is required to optimize mRNA design, intracellular delivery and applications beyond SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. In this Review, we describe the technologies that underlie mRNA vaccines, with an emphasis on lipid nanoparticles and other non-viral delivery vehicles.

> In January, 1892, the English social reformer and women's rights campaigner Josephine Butler wrote to her son, Stanley, to complain of fatigue and a general declension of the spirits. Butler attributed her symptoms to an attack of “Russian influenza” the previous Christmas, which had left her with painful conjunctivitis and inflamed lungs. “I don't think I ever remember being so weak, not even after the malaria fever at Genoa”, she confessed. 3 months later there was little improvement. “I am so weak that if I read or write for half an hour I become so tired and faint that I have to lie down,” Butler informed a friend ...

> The result was that by the middle 1890s Russian influenza was being blamed in England for everything from the suicide rate to the general sense of malaise that marked the fin de siècle, and the image of a nation of convalescents, too debilitated to work or return to daily routines, and plagued with mysterious and erratic symptoms and chronic illnesses, had become central to the period's medical and cultural iconography.",pcalku,pcalku,buddyboys,1,covid19

Nevertheless, during the 12-month follow-up visit in the COVID-19 recovery cohort, anti-S IgG/IgM/IgA and NAb titers represented a sustained decline (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S2b, c). For the neutralizing antibodies, median of NAb titers decreased from 631 at Month 1 to 604 at Month 3, to 134 at Month 8 and to 84 at Month 12. For the IgG antibodies, the median of signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) dropped from 28.6 at Month 1 to 27.7 at Month 3, 11.5 at Month 8 and 7.2 at Month 12. At Month 12, the levels of specific antibodies were much lower than the levels at Month 1 (82.8%, 96.4%, and 89.4% decrease for IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, respectively).

Introduction: School-based COVID-19 mitigation strategies have greatly impacted the primary school day (children aged 3-11) including: wearing face coverings, 2-metre distancing, no mixing of children, and no breakfast clubs or extra-curricular activities. This study examines these mitigation methods and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK.

Methods: A school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank.

Results: Responses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1-5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement 2-metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a 2-metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school.

Conclusions:
Implementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, 2-metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school. Primary school staff found teaching challenging during COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger learners and those with additional learning needs.",pc57l7,pc57l7,MummersFart,1,covid19

Significance
Asymptomatic infections have been widely reported for COVID-19. However, many studies do not distinguish between the presymptomatic stage and truly asymptomatic infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 literature reporting laboratory-confirmed infections to determine the burden of asymptomatic infections and removed index cases from our calculations to avoid conflation. By analyzing over 350 papers, we estimated that more than one-third of infections are truly asymptomatic. We found evidence of greater asymptomaticity in children compared with the elderly, and lower asymptomaticity among cases with comorbidities compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. Greater asymptomaticity at younger ages suggests that heightened vigilance is needed among these individuals, to prevent spillover into the broader community.

Abstract
Quantification of asymptomatic infections is fundamental for effective public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Discrepancies regarding the extent of asymptomaticity have arisen from inconsistent terminology as well as conflation of index and secondary cases which biases toward lower asymptomaticity. 
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 2, 2021 to identify studies that reported silent infections at the time of testing, whether presymptomatic or asymptomatic. Index cases were removed to minimize representational bias that would result in overestimation of symptomaticity. 
By analyzing over 350 studies, we estimate that the percentage of infections that never developed clinical symptoms, and thus were truly asymptomatic, was 35.1% (95% CI: 30.7 to 39.9%). 
At the time of testing, 42.8% (95% prediction interval: 5.2 to 91.1%) of cases exhibited no symptoms, a group comprising both asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. 
Asymptomaticity was significantly lower among the elderly, at 19.7% (95% CI: 12.7 to 29.4%) compared with children at 46.7% (95% CI: 32.0 to 62.0%). 
We also found that cases with comorbidities had significantly lower asymptomaticity compared to cases with no underlying medical conditions. 
Without proactive policies to detect asymptomatic infections, such as rapid contact tracing, prolonged efforts for pandemic control may be needed even in the presence of vaccination.",pc43kw,pc43kw,MummersFart,1,covid19

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced the initiation of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the approval of a booster (third) dose of COMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. The companies intend to complete submission of the sBLA by the end of this week.

>The sBLA includes data from a Phase 3 clinical trial of 306 participants 18-55 years of age who received a booster (third) dose of COMIRNATY between 4.8 and 8 months after completing the two-dose primary regimen, with a median follow-up time of 2.6 months post-booster. The booster (third) dose of COMIRNATY elicited robust neutralizing antibodies to the wild-type strain in participants who were without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through one-month post-dose-three. SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after the third dose were 3.3 times the titers after the second dose. The post-dose-three neutralizing titers met the prespecified 1.5-fold non-inferiority criterion for success and were statistically superior. Moreover, 99.5% of participants had a four-fold response after the third dose, compared to 98.0% after the second dose. The titers after dose three met the pre-specified 10% non-inferiority margin for the difference in the four-fold seroresponse rates.

>The reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster (third) dose was typically mild to moderate. The most common events included injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, and chills. The frequency of any severe systemic event after the booster dose was low. The frequency of reactogenicity was similar to or better than after dose two of the primary series. The adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical data for COMIRNATY.

>Pfizer and BioNTech intend to submit these data to a peer-reviewed journal, as well as file these data with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities around the world in the coming weeks.",pc025s,pc025s,RufusSG,1,covid19

SARS-CoV-2 and its variants continue to infect hundreds of thousands every day despite the rollout of effective vaccines. Therefore, it is essential to understand the levels of protection that these vaccines provide in the face of emerging variants. Here, we report two demographically balanced cohorts of BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients, from which we evaluate neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) variants. We show that both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 are less well neutralized by serum from vaccinated individuals, and that B.1.351, but not B.1.1.7, is less well neutralized by convalescent serum. We also find that the levels of variant-specific anti-spike antibodies are proportional to neutralizing activities. Together, our results demonstrate the escape of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants from neutralization by serum antibodies, which may lead to reduced protection from re-infection or increased risk of vaccine breakthrough.",pbyvig,pbyvig,icloudbug,1,covid19

Background:  
Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun   
to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by   
previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear.  
   
Methods:  
We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups:  
 (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the   
BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected   
individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and  
single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic   
regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four   
outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related   
hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14,   
2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.  
Results:  
SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11)   
increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant   
compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection   
or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The   
increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as   
well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before   
vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning   
natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had  
a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough   
infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for   
symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees were also at a greater   
risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were   
previously infected.  
Conclusions:  
This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and  
stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and   
hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to   
the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were   
both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the   
vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.",pbkxip,pbkxip,IOnlyEatFermions,1,covid19

In other words, they mostly studied healthier younger folks - though not exclusively. There's no stratification to elucidate those most at risk; nursing home folks (make up roughly 40%-50% of covid deaths), obesity & Overweight (could have been included or not, but no data to determine the percentage of obese/overweight), diabetes etc.

Here are the exclusion criteria in short: Populations where confounding could not be adequately addressed, Long-term care facility residents, Confined to homes for medical reasons (people with comorbidities? or ... ?), Health care workers, & Data on body-mass index or residential area were missing.

In addition, they had predefined adversities they were looking for, but I don't see death comparisons or many other adversities. Does this mean that in the covid group vs the vax'd, there were no deaths reported? Also, why not also have a control group of folks that had neither covid or the vaxed. In other words, why not include the unvaccinated who also didn't get covid.

I'm NOT a data geek, so very likely my observations above are benign/naive. But wondering if the above exclusions are of merit in determining real world adversities.

Any ideas?

habwaub,1629919401.0,smaskens,"#Abstract
**Background:** Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear.

**Methods:** We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.

**Results:** SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P<0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naive vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected. 

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.",pbgbnv,pbgbnv,icloudbug,1,covid19
hadscaq,1629949553.0,large_pp_smol_brain,"> In model 1, we examined natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity by comparing the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes between previously infected individuals who have never been vaccinated and fully vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals. These groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, GSA and time of first event. The first event (the preliminary exposure) was either the time of administration of the second dose of the vaccine or the time of documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 (a positive RT-PCR test result), both occurring between January 1, 2021 and February 28, 2021. Thereby, we matched the “immune activation” time of both groups, examining the long-term protection conferred when vaccination or infection occurred within the same time period. The three-month interval between the first event and the second event was implemented in order to capture reinfections (as opposed to prolonged viral shedding) by following the 90-day guideline

> [...]

> During the follow-up period, 257 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded, of which 238 occurred in the vaccinated group (breakthrough infections) and 19 in the previously infected group (reinfections). **After adjusting for comorbidities, we found a statistically significant 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection as opposed to reinfection (P<0.001)**. Apart from age ≥60 years, there was no statistical evidence that any of the assessed comorbidities significantly affected the risk of an infection during the follow-up period (Table 2a). As for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 infections during the follow-up period, 199 cases were recorded, 191 of which were in the vaccinated group and 8 in the previously infected group. Symptoms for all analyses were recorded in the central database within 5 days of the positive RT-PCR test for 90% of the patients, and included chiefly fever, cough, breathing difficulties, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell, myalgia, weakness, headache and sore throat. **After adjusting for comorbidities, we found a 27.02-fold risk (95% CI, 12.7 to 57.5) for symptomatic breakthrough infection**


This is astounding. I actually had to read the numbers a few times and re-read the paragraphs to make sure I wasn’t misreading. They are saying previously infected but unvaccinated people were **twenty seven** times less likely to have symptomatic COVID than vaccinated naive persons. That almost seems hard to believe. Right now, COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is debated but often falls between 60-85%. **If** vaccination were 60% effective, then a further 27-fold OR reduction would be about 0.4/27 or 0.015. That’s an extremely high level of protection...

Now, at least some of this effect could be explained by behavior. Ostensibly, vaccinated persons are more likely to take COVID seriously and get tested if they become ill, and also undergo regular testing for work or other engagements, whereas unvaccinated people (who also previously got sick) may be less likely to take COVID seriously, and therefore less likely to get tested. However, it seems hard to imagine that accounting for a 27-fold change.

* vaccinated cohort: should be near 100% of vaccinated people. It’s in a central database

So we have an unbiased sample of vaccinated people, but our sample of who is infected is a biased sample. Why does this matter? Well, multiple studies have shown that asymptomatic infections generate a milder immune response. Here’s one: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6

Yes they adjusted for comorbidities, but even within those groups there are always people more or less susceptible to death. A break down of enrichment for high risk factors/age/etc in the reinfected people in each arm could be helpful, as well as as estimate of death rate in the initial “ infected and unvaxxed” candidate pool.

Another potential confounder is exposure differences (due to social-network differences) between the two arms. For example, the ultra-orthodox Jewish community (who made up a disproportionate fraction of the unvaccinated population in Israel earlier this year, and had disproportionately high rates of infection in earlier waves) were relatively sheltered from Delta until mid August when schools reopened, after which Delta began spreading in the community and cases increased dramatically. The study ended before this wave, and so any reinfections in this period would not have been captured by the study - these individuals would be been counted as “not reinfected”, although they were disproportionately unexposed.

Having previously contracted doesn't really say anything about immune status unless you want to undergo titer testing at an individual level.

> Associations between vaccine breakthrough cases and infection by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have remained largely unexplored. Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization (L452R, L452Q, E484K, and/or F490S) (78% versus 48%, p = 1.96e-08), but not by those associated with increased infectivity (L452R and/or N501Y) (85% versus 77%, p = 0.092). Differences in viral loads were non-significant between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated persons overall (p = 0.99) and according to lineage (p = 0.09 - 0.78). Viral loads were significantly higher in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases (p < 0.0001), and symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections had similar viral loads to unvaccinated infections (p = 0.64). In 5 cases with available longitudinal samples for serologic analyses, vaccine breakthrough infections were found to be associated with low or undetectable neutralizing antibody levels attributable to immunocompromised state or infection by an antibody-resistant lineage. These findings suggest that vaccine breakthrough cases are preferentially caused by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections, regardless of the infecting lineage.",pbgbg1,pbgbg1,icloudbug,1,covid19

This can result in significant undercounting of COVID-19 attributable deaths, making it challenging to understand the total mortality burden of the pandemic. Excess mortality, which is defined as the increase in observed death counts compared to a baseline expectation, provides an alternate measure of the mortality shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we use data from civil death registers for 54 municipalities across the state of Gujarat, India, to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality. Using a model fit to monthly data from January 2019 to February 2020, we estimate excess mortality over the course of the pandemic from March 2020 to April 2021. We estimated 16,000 [95% CI: 14,000, 18,000] excess deaths across these municipalities since March 2020. The sharpest increase in deaths was observed in April 2021, with an estimated 480% [95% CI: 390%, 580%] increase in mortality from expected counts for the same period. Females and the 40 to 60 age groups experienced a greater increase from baseline mortality compared to other demographic groups.

There were two comparison groups vaccinated with the homologous CoronaVac (N = 79) and AZD1222 (N = 80) regimen. All sera samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). The neutralizing activity in a subset of serum samples was tested against the original Wuhan strain and variants of concern, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). The CoronaVac followed by the AZD1222 vaccine induced higher levels of spike RBD-specific IgG than that of two-dose CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccines (p < 0.001). Sera samples of the CoronaVac/AZD1222 vaccine recipients elicited higher neutralizing antibody activity against the original Wuhan and the B.1.351 strain than in the recipients of the two-dose CoronaVac or AZD1222.

>In July, the Company reported interim Phase 1/2a data published in the New England Journal of Medicine that demonstrated neutralizing antibody responses generated by the Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine were strong and stable through eight months after immunization.

>In anticipation of the potential need for boosters, the Company conducted two Phase 1/2a studies in individuals previously vaccinated with its single-shot vaccine. New interim data from these studies demonstrate that a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generated a rapid and robust increase in spike-binding antibodies, nine-fold higher than 28 days after the primary single-dose vaccination. Significant increases in binding antibody responses were observed in participants between ages 18 and 55, and in those 65 years and older who received a lower booster dose. The study summaries were submitted to medRxiv on August 24.

>“We have established that a single shot of our COVID-19 vaccine generates strong and robust immune responses that are durable and persistent through eight months. With these new data, we also see that a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine further increases antibody responses among study participants who had previously received our vaccine,” said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, Johnson & Johnson. “We look forward to discussing with public health officials a potential strategy for our Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, boosting eight months or longer after the primary single-dose vaccination.”

>The Company is engaging with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other health authorities regarding boosting with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

habyppf,1629920362.0,SparePlatypus,"Various mutations in viruses that ultimately have the side effect of making people less sick for one reason or the other have been documented in the past, both with SARS COV 2 and other viruses.  if we are observing SC2 variants with similar mutations presented in this paper taking off in the wild & gaining traction (unlikely for particular mutation described as this would be counter-productive for spread) we can make educated guesses that those variants *might* result in less severe illness, or loss of ability for the virus to spread as easily, Or both. And we can make those guesses ahead of time before long studies prove whether that's what's occuring.  That's useful to know. 

The more immediately practical insight this provides is optimal design of live attenuated vaccines, they use a real virus as a starting point, which is great because it most closely resembles what you're trying to protect from in future unintended encounters

However if you're going to be intentionally giving people a virus you want it to be as safe as possible. Obviously in it's default form this isn't the case for SC2, which is why we don't just spray virus samples in the air to immunize everyone asap in lieu of vaccination which has much better safety profile. This paper shows--, at least in animal models--  that SC2 viruses with 'faulty' or missing furin cleavage system could be effective as immunogens, (also for variants)  whilst giving lower burden of illness which is good to know for attenuated vaccines. 

 There is at least one live attenuated vaccine which entirely deletes the furin cleavage as one side of it's design strategy and hence this paper indirectly affirms that could be a salient & rational design choice lowering the potentiality of sickness occuring. Initial results from phase 1 trials expected within a month or so.",pb8i9n,habnpza,nimitpathak51,2,covid19

Taken together, our findings revealed that the loss of the furin cleavage site causes attenuation in the airway tissues of hamsters and highlighted the potential benefits of S gene mutants as potential immunogens.""

ha8ffz3,1629852348.0,tozalo,">Abstract

>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, employs two key host proteins to gain entry and replicate within cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). TMPRSS2 was first characterized as an androgen-regulated gene in the prostate. Supporting a role for sex hormones, males relative to females are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in terms of mortality and morbidity. Several studies, including one employing a large epidemiological cohort, suggested that blocking androgen signaling is protective against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that androgens regulate the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and androgen receptor (AR) in subsets of lung epithelial cells. AR levels are markedly elevated in males relative to females greater than 70 y of age. In males greater than 70 y old, smoking was associated with elevated levels of AR and ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. Transcriptional repression of the AR enhanceosome with AR or bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) antagonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Taken together, these studies support further investigation of transcriptional inhibition of critical host factors in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

haa8ygs,1629894511.0,Smooth_Imagination,"So these are secreted enzymes that ""Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) catalyses the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids. So far, more than 30 enzymes that possess PLA(2) or related activity have been identified in mammals. About one third of these enzymes belong to the secreted PLA(2) (sPLA(2)) family, which comprises low molecular weight, Ca(2+) requiring, secreted enzymes""

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21746768/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21746768/)

From below and the original link, the type of phospholipase A2 that does seem correlated is an 'inflammatory-type' as per the following link, which looks at the family of enzymes as antivirals. The Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 was not active as an antiviral against HIV;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC408539/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC408539/)

""Various inhibitors and catalytic products of sPLA2 have no effect on HIV-1 infection, suggesting that sPLA2 catalytic activity is not involved in the antiviral effect. Instead, the antiviral activity appears to involve a specific interaction of sPLA2s to host cells. Indeed, of 11 sPLA2s from venom and mammalian tissues assayed, 4 venom sPLA2s were found to be very potent HIV-1 inhibitors (ID50 < 1 nM) and also to bind specifically to host cells with high affinities (K0.5 < 1 nM). Although mammalian pancreatic group IB and inflammatory-type group IIA sPLA2s were inactive against HIV-1 replication, our results could be of physiological interest, as novel sPLA2s are being characterized in humans.""

Maybe the action here is that some of the secreted phospholipase A2 enzymes initiate internal antiviral mechanisms in the cell, such as RNase L (totally spitballing here), but this particular one does not, and more so acts on activating the inflammatory behavoir or expansion of certain immune cells or aggregation of platelets.

Aha

Group V Secreted Phospholipase A2 Induces the Release of Proangiogenic and Antiangiogenic Factors by Human Neutrophils

""sPLA2s activate immune cells such as human neutrophils (PMNs) by enzymatic activity- or receptor-mediated mechanisms. In addition, human PMNs synthesize and store human group V (hGV) and human group X (hGX) sPLA2s in their granules, but only the former is released upon cellular activation""

These are not the particular type of phospholipase, but interesting potentially, so lets continue searching -

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515419/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515419/)

""Recent studies have suggested the involvement of the pro-inflammatory secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2)-IIA in atherogenesis. This enzyme is produced by different cell types through stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is detectable in the intima and in media smooth muscle cells, not only in atherosclerotic lesions but also in the very early stages of atherogenesis. sPLA2-IIA can hydrolyse the phospholipid monolayers of low density lipoproteins (LDL). Such modified LDL show increased affinity to proteoglycans. The modified particles have a greater tendency to aggregate and an enhanced ability to insert cholesterol into cells. This modification may promote macrophage LDL uptake leading to the formation of foam cells. Furthermore, sPLA2-IIA is not only a mediator for localized inflammation but may be also used as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes. An interaction between activated RAS and phospholipases has been indicated by observations showing that inhibitors of sPLA2 decrease angiotensin (Ang) II-induced macrophage lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, various interactions between Ang II and oxLDL have been demonstrated suggesting a central role of sPLA2-IIA in these processes and offering a possible target for treatment. The role of sPLA2-IIA in the perpetuation of atherosclerosis appears to be the missing link between inflammation, activated RAS and lipidperoxidation.""

< This does look very relevant.

""**During infection, levels of circulating sPLA2, enzymatic activity and plasma lipid peroxidation were maximal at day-14**, the peak of parasitaemia. Levels of hGIIA mRNA increased in liver but not in spleen and blood cells, suggesting that liver may contribute as a source of circulating hGIIA sPLA2. Before infection, baseline levels of leukocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines were higher in TG mice than WT littermates. U**pon infection, the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes increased and were maximal at the peak of parasitaemia in both WT and TG mice, but were higher in TG mice**. Similarly, levels of the Th1 cytokines **IFN-γ and IL-2** increased in WT and TG mice, but were **7.7- and 1.7-fold higher in TG mice**. ""

\- mice engineered to have higher sPLA-2-IIA have greater expansion of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes upon infection at a time frame similar to that of illness after SARS-Cov-2 infection, and they have much higher IFN gamma. and its also been shown in mice that a late and increased IFN gamma level is associated with worse outcomes in SARS / Covid model illness.

It seems that this enzyme could be partially causal not just a marker, via involvement with lipid peroxidation.

It seems this is common to a range of infectious challenges -

Platelets release mitochondria serving as substrate for bactericidal group IIA-secreted phospholipase A2 to promote inflammation

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082876/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082876/)

""Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a highly potent inflammatory trigger and is reportedly found outside the cells in blood in various pathologies. Platelets are abundant in blood where they promote hemostasis. Although lacking a nucleus, platelets contain functional mitochondria. On activation, platelets produce extracellular vesicles known as microparticles. We hypothesized that activated platelets could also release their mitochondria. We show that activated platelets release respiratory-competent mitochondria, both within membrane-encapsulated microparticles and as free organelles. Extracellular mitochondria are found in platelet concentrates used for transfusion and are present at higher levels in those that induced acute reactions (febrile nonhemolytic reactions, skin manifestations, and cardiovascular events) in transfused patients. We establish that the mitochondrion is an endogenous substrate of secreted phospholipase A2 IIA (sPLA2-IIA), a phospholipase otherwise specific for bacteria, likely reflecting the ancestral proteobacteria origin of mitochondria. The hydrolysis of the mitochondrial membrane by sPLA2-IIA yields inflammatory mediators (ie, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and mtDNA) that promote leukocyte activation. Two-photon microscopy in live transfused animals revealed that extracellular mitochondria interact with neutrophils in vivo, triggering neutrophil adhesion to the endothelial wall.

As of 13th August 2021; 2,583 patients have been recruited.

We also include in the analysis, data obtained from 231 healthy individuals from the PITCH (Protective Immunity from T cells in Healthcare workers) study. **Overall, in comparison to PITCH where 100% of tested individuals (n=93) generated anti-Spike antibodies after vaccine doses, 89% of patients within OCTAVE seroconverted 4 weeks after second vaccine dose. By corollary, approximately 11% of patients across all disease cohorts fail to generate antibodies that react to SARS-CoV-2 spike 4 weeks after two vaccines. Failure to generate spike reactive antibodies was found at a higher proportion in some specific patient subgroups, particularly AAV (72.4%), HD-IS (16.7%) and HepD (16.7%).** Importantly, all recruited AAV patients had received Rituximab; a targeted B cell depletion therapy. **Furthermore, even in those who seroconverted, 40% of patients across disease cohorts generate lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity compared to healthy subjects after two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines**; the functional significance of these findings in providing protection from subsequent SARS-CoV-2 exposure is not currently known. In contrast to the observed serological response, evaluation of the Spike-specific T cell response revealed that across all patient sub-groups (including AAV) a response similar to healthy individuals was generated. **Our data argue strongly for further vaccination strategies to optimise humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with chronic diseases and/or patients on immune suppressive therapies.**",payet8,payet8,buddyboys,1,covid19

In people primed with two doses of mRNA-1273, a single dose of mRNA-1273.351 produced ID50s of 1400, which is many times higher than we'd expect from a first dose in naive individuals, and in fact is pretty comparable to what you get after 2 doses.",pax7xb,pax7xb,buddyboys,1,covid19

In figure 4 it shows that the .351 booster had a similar boost versus the beta (.351) variant compared to people merely boosted with the original mRNA-1273. Isn't this consistent with the possibility that the vaccine merely boosted antibodies that were already reactive to both variants?

I'm no expert but I don't see how this rules out original antigenic sin. It would have seemed more encouraging if the .351 booster had shown a larger boost versus the beta variant compared to boosting with the original vaccine.

This might not matter all that much for variants with such a low degree of escape, but if it's just boosting antibodies raised against the original antigen then I could see it being an issue if we try to make vaccines for future variants that show greater escape.",pax7xb,ha8nk1o,uh-okay-I-guess,2,covid19

Basically the exposure to the first variant causes immune system to “not see” the second variant.

Even worse is a related phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). With ADE, exposure to one variant either through vaccination or infection actually causes you do you have an enhanced (more severe) response to another variant. This is what happens with dengue fever, which has four or five different variants. It is why in general dengue fever vaccines are no longer given. They can cause you to have a worse response when exposed to a different variant.

We have identified a new SARS-CoV-2 variant assigned to the PANGO lineage C.1.2. This variant has been detected throughout the third wave of infections in South Africa from May 2021 onwards and has been detected in seven other countries within Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania. The identification of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is commonly associated with new waves of infection. Like several other VOCs, C.1.2 has accumulated a number of substitutions beyond  what  would be expected  from  the background  SARS-CoV-2  evolutionary rate.  This suggests the likelihood that these mutations arose during a period of accelerated evolution in a single individual with prolonged viral infection through virus-host co-evolution19–21. Deletions within the NTD (like Y144del, seen in C.1.2 and other VOCs) have been evident in cases of prolonged infection, further supporting this hypothesis22–24.C.1.2 containsmany mutations that have been identified in all four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma) and three VOIs (Kappa, Eta and Lambda) as well as additional mutations within the NTD (C136F), RBD (Y449H), and adjacent to the furin cleavage site (N679K). Many of the shared  mutations  have  been  associated  with  improved  ACE2  binding  (N501Y)25–29or  furin cleavage (H655Y and P681H/R)30–32, and reduced neutralization activity (particularly Y144del, 242-244del,   and   E484K)17,33–39,providing   sufficient   cause   for   concern   of   continued transmission  of  this  variant.  Future  work  aims  to  determine  the  functional  impact  of  these mutations, which likely include neutralizing antibody escape, and to investigate whether their combination confers a replicative fitness advantage over the Delta variant.The  C.1.2  lineage  is  continuing  to  grow.  At  the  time  of  submission  (20  August  2021)  there were 80 C.1.2 sequences in GISAID with it now having been detected in Botswana and in the Northern Cape of South Africa",patisi,patisi,icloudbug,1,covid19

Antibodies were not expected to stay around for long since that isn't how our bodies work. Instead we have to be exposed to something to activate our antibodies. That means we may end up testing positive after being exposed but our body ""remembers"" how to make antibodies again so can being sooner giving the virus less time to replicate. The reason we may be seeing more symptoms is because the viral load is so high with the Delta variant that there is enough virus replicate to create infection but our body still fights it off better than it would have if we hadn't been vaccinated. 

It would have been nice if the vaccines stopped infection and transmission but it wasn't expected.

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded ‘down’ to an exposed ‘up’ state to bind the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ states have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy, details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here over 130 µs of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection.",paqwvp,paqwvp,,1,covid19

ha7zkh7,1629845121.0,SparePlatypus," Various compounds exploiting this step of viral entry to act as glycan probes, to inhibit proliferation have been proposed, not just for SARS but other virus' -- many of the proposals are not even established 'drugs' per SE but proteins isolated from foodstuffs - lectins extracted from natural sources like legume or algae the main and most relevant in this respect

Heres a more recent study using lectin isolated from plain old lentils..

[Lentil lectin derived from Lens culinaris exhibit broad antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330776/)

> We found that lentil lectin specifically bind to oligomannose-type glycans and GlcNAc at non-reducing end terminus and have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against mutant strains and epidemic variants. [B .1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1]
>Lentil lectin also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. **We found lentil lectin could block the binding of ACE2 to S trimer and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the early steps of infection**


Then there's  Griffithsin, a compound extracted from red algae and one of the most powerful broad spectrum antivirals ever tested,-  something that's getting alot of attention finally in phase 3 HIV trials after more than a decade, it is ( patented and owned by [United States of America itself](https://patents.justia.com/patent/8088729). The utility of this compound against SARS and potentially future derivatives is directly mentioned in the 2006 patent application, referencing several prior studies. 

>  ""the invention provides a method of inhibiting prophylactically or therapeutically a viral infection, in particular an influenza viral infection (e.g., an H5N1 viral infection), a SARS infection, an Ebola infection, a Hepatitis C viral infection, or HIV infection, of a host. ""

Despite the patent filing itself highlighting the possible risk of a future SARS resurgence as incentive for further investigation/usage of Griffithsin, the compound has received little traction during the pandemic. Here are a few papers  on it anyway for anyone curious, at least to me the results suggest further investigation wouldn't be a bad idea 

[Broad-spectrum in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of the antiviral protein griffithsin against emerging viruses of the family Coronaviridae --2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20032190/)

> Here we report the utility of the potent antiviral protein griffithsin (GRFT) in the prevention of SARS-CoV infection both in vitro and in vivo. **We also show that GRFT specifically binds to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and inhibits viral entry**. Finally, we show that GRFT treatment has a positive effect on morbidity and mortality in a lethal infection model using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and also specifically inhibits deleterious aspects of the host immunological response to SARS infection in mammals. 


[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection is inhibited by griffithsin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27424494/)

> Time course experiments show that griffithsin inhibits MERS-CoV infection at the binding step. In conclusion, **we identify griffithsin as a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV infection at the entry step**. 

[Griffithsin with A Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Activity by Binding Glycans in Viral Glycoprotein Exhibits Strong Synergistic Effect in Combination with A Pan-Coronavirus Fusion Inhibitor Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike S2 Subunit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7554295/)

> GRFT inhibited live SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 63 nmol/L, which is about 11-fold more potent than remdesivir with half-maximal effective concentration of 0.77 μmol/L against SARS-CoV-2 infection  Moreover, we found that GRFT potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell–cell fusion with an IC50 of 323 nmol/L (Fig. 1D). To the best of our knowledge, these results, for the first time, confirm that **GRFT is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.**

Followup in vivo study in animals:

[A bivalent protein targeting glycans and HR1 domain in spike protein potently inhibited infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34238357/)

> GL25E [GRFT & EK1]showed highly potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as other HCoVs, **it is a promising candidate for further development as a broad-spectrum anti-HCoV therapeutic and prophylactic to treat and prevent COVID-19 and other emerging HCoV diseases**


Similar promising early findings have been observed with other lectins for instance both with SC2 and other viruses, like influenza, Here's research published in *Cell* from more than a year back on a lectin from hyacinth beans, that seems to have different mode of action:

https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31001-9?

> Here, we show that the lectin FRIL, isolated from hyacinth beans (Lablab purpureus), has anti-influenza and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. FRIL can neutralize 11 representative human and avian influenza strains at low nanomolar concentrations

> **FRIL also effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, preventing viral protein production and cytopathic effect in host cells**. These findings suggest a potential application of FRIL for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza and COVID-19.

> we have demonstrated that FRIL is effective both in vitro and in vivo. **Furthermore, FRIL’s neutralizing ability is at least on par with most known antiviral, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies**""",paqwvp,ha6wqww,luisvel,2,covid19

ha65hfn,1629818253.0,yaolilylu,"**Design, Setting, and Participants**  

This study used a large, population-based cohort of 730 individuals (index patients) who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 8 to July 30, **2020**, along with a contact tracing surveillance program. Field workers visited 8852 close contacts of the index patients and evaluated them for COVID-19 through August 2020. A timeline was constructed to characterize different exposure periods between index patients and their contacts.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  

The primary outcome was the attack rate of COVID-19, defined as the total number of new COVID-19 cases diagnosed among contacts of index patients divided by the total number of exposed contacts. A secondary outcome was asymptomatic clinical presentation among infected contacts. Relative risks were calculated to investigate risk factors for COVID-19 among contacts and asymptomatic clinical presentation among infected contacts.

**Results**  

Among 8852 close contacts (4679 male contacts \[52.9%\]; median age, 41 years \[interquartile range, 28-54 years\]) of 730 index patients (374 male patients \[51.2%\]; median age, 46 years \[interquartile range, 36-56 years\]), contacts were at highest risk of COVID-19 if they were exposed between 2 days before and 3 days after the index patient’s symptom onset, **peaking at day 0** (adjusted relative risk \[ARR\], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5). Compared with being exposed to an asymptomatic index patient, the risk of COVID-19 among contacts was higher when they were exposed to index patients with mild (ARR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.8-9.1) and moderate (ARR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-9.7) cases of COVID-19. As index case severity increased, infected contacts were less likely to be asymptomatic (exposed to patient with mild COVID-19: ARR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; exposed to patient with moderate COVID-19: ARR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8).

**Conclusions and Relevance**  

This cohort study found that individuals with COVID-19 were most infectious a few days before and after symptom onset. Infected contacts of asymptomatic index patients were less likely to present with COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting that quantity of exposure may be associated with clinical presentation in close contacts.",pan914,pan914,icloudbug,1,covid19

If the above is a correct interpretation, it's clearly important that delta apparently has a 5 aOR of a patient requiring supplemental O2 - clinically I'm sure that means delta is associated with more severe disease, but how severe is not clear (especially when they say they included low-dose o2) and to describe the composite outcome as including ICU admission and death makes this seem even more alarming than it is.",pan7ya,pan7ya,icloudbug,1,covid19

Background

  
he impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) on disease severity is unclear. In this retrospective study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020.  
  
Methods

  
National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all patients with VOC infection admitted to our center between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted from January-April 2020.  
  
Results

  
829 patients in Singapore in the study period were infected with these 3 VOCs. **After adjusting for age and sex, B.1.617.2 was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.90, \[95% CI 1.43-30.78\]). 157 of these patients were admitted to our center. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1.88 \[95% CI 0.95-3.76\]) compared with wild-type.** These differences were not seen with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Vaccination status was associated with decreased severity. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type).  
  
Conclusions

  
There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide an impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programs.",pan7ya,pan7ya,icloudbug,1,covid19

We detected IgG against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, neutralizing antibodies against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, and used SARS-CoV-2 peptides to detect IFN-g and IL-2 specific T cell responses in a cohort of CoronaVac vaccinees ( N=101) and convalescent ( N=72) individuals. Findings. Among vaccinees, 95% displayed T cell or antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 as compared to 99% convalescent individuals. However, we observed that among vaccinees, males and individuals 55 years or older developed significantly lower anti-RBD, anti-NP and neutralizing antibody responses as well as antigen-induced IL-2 production by T cells. Interpretation. Even though some studies indicated Coronavac helped reduce mortality among elderly people, considering the current dominance of the gamma variant of concern (VOC) and potential increase of the delta VOC, in Brazil, our data support that Coronavac vaccinees above 55 years old are likely to benefit from a third dose to boost immune response and protection",palwjz,palwjz,No_Entertainment_764,1,covid19

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable efficacy, especially in preventing severe illness and hospitalization. However, the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study, we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. **Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses, including those specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19.** mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together, this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and has implications for future booster strategies.",paiv66,paiv66,icloudbug,1,covid19

**Background**   
Recent evidence indicates a potential therapeutic role of fluvoxamine for COVID-19.  In the TOGETHER randomized platform clinical trial for acutely symptomatic patients with COVID-19, we assessed the efficacy of fluvoxamine vs. placebo in preventing either extended emergency room observation or hospitalization due to COVID-19. Herein, we report the preliminary findings.

  
**Methods**  
This placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo.  The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization. 

Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing.

  
**Results**   
The study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female. The proportion of patients observed in an emergency room for >6 hours or admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared to placebo (77/739 vs 108/733; Relative Risk \[RR\]: 0.71; 95% Bayesian Credible Interval \[95% BCI\]: 0.54 - 0.93), with a probability of superiority of 99.4% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference 4.3%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 88% were hospitalizations. We found no significant relative effects  between the fluvoxamine and placebo groups on viral clearance at day 7 (Odds ratio \[OR\]: 0.75; 95% Confidence Intervals \[95% CI\]: 0.53 - 1.07), mortality (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.30), time to death (Hazard ratio \[HR\]: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58 -1.08), days hospitalized (Mean Difference (MD) 1.22 days; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.53), number of days ventilated (MD 1.10; 95% CI: 0.70 - 1.73) or other secondary outcomes.

ha5hbif,1629806742.0,yaolilylu,"ABSTRACT 

Importance: Thromboses after the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1-S have been reported. Better understanding of population-level thrombotic risks after COVID-19 vaccination is needed. 

Objective: Quantify associations of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 with major arterial, venous and thrombocytopenic events. Design: Cohort study based on linked electronic health records, with follow up from December 8th, 2020, to March 18th, 2021. Setting and participants: Adults registered with an NHS general practice in England and alive on December 8th, 2020. Exposures: First dose of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) for major arterial, venous and thrombocytopenic outcomes 1-28 and >28 days after first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 vaccine. Analyses were performed separately for ages <70 and ≥70 years, and adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and social and demographic factors. 

Results: Of 46,162,942 adults, 21,193,814 (46%) had their first vaccination during follow-up. Adjusted HRs 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S, compared with pre-vaccination rates, at ages <70 and ≥70 respectively, were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.9-1.05) and 0.58 (0.53-0.63) for venous thromboses, and 0.90 (0.86-0.95) and 0.76 (0.73-0.79) for arterial thromboses. Corresponding HRs for BNT162b2 were 0.81 (0.74-0.88) and 0.57 (0.53-0.62) for venous thromboses, and 0.94 (0.90-0.99) and 0.72 (0.70-0.75) for arterial thromboses. HRs for thrombotic events were higher at younger ages for venous thromboses after ChAdOx1-S, and for arterial thromboses after both vaccines. Rates of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and thrombocytopenia in adults aged <70 years were higher 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S (adjusted HRs 2.27, 95% CI:1.33-3.88 and 1.71, 1.35-2.16 respectively), but not after BNT162b2 (0.59, 0.24-1.45 and 1.00, 0.75-1.34) compared with pre-vaccination. The corresponding **absolute excess risks of ICVT 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S were 0.9-3 per million, varying by age and sex**. 

Conclusions and Relevance: Increases in ICVT and thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in adults aged <70 years are small compared with its effect in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, although more precise estimates for adults <40 years are needed. **For people aged ≥70 years, rates of arterial or venous thrombotic, events were generally lower after either vaccine.**",pagl3x,pagl3x,icloudbug,1,covid19

AstraZeneca roughly doubles the risk of vaccine-induced thrombosis/thrombocytopenia, from a population base rate of approximately 1 per million, to around 2 per million. Pfizer did not increase the risk. 

For both AstraZeneca and Pfizer, the risk of *normal* blood clots decreased somewhat after vaccination. (Possibly because they prevented Covid-induced blood clots?)",pagl3x,ha5hbif,yaolilylu,2,covid19

ha65jrs,1629818281.0,RufusSG,"Going to add/paraphrase Jeremy Kamil's critique as well:

""A couple problems with this preprint that do not support the alarmist take is pushes…

First, they don’t study neutralization of the authentic entry pathway being used by SARS-CoV-2 because from their methods it’s clear they are using HEK-293T ACE2 cells… no TMPRSS2.. that’s an important difference.

The slower, cathepsin catalyzed entry pathway lacking TMPRSS2 can look more “infectious” (it’s the same one blocked by HCQ) but it’s also not the pathway that drives the pandemic.. that one is called “rapid” or “surface” entry.

Another problem for the authors’ overblown claims of “poised for total vaccine escape”… we already know that mRNA vaccines defend very well against disease.. even from the beta (B.1.351) variant.. which is MORE immune evasive than delta!

Back to TMPRSS2 and the “furin cleavage” site (FCS)..PRRAR, or in delta, RRRAR. The FCS site is what is cleaved by furin proteases in the Golgi of infected cells to “pre-prime” newly assembled Spikes so viral progeny can spread via “rapid” entry at the surface of new host cells..

TMPRSS2 cuts a second site called S2’ to trigger the final fusion event.. without the FCS, SARS-CoV-2 loses its ability to cause disease & certainly wouldn’t be a pandemic virus.. see @TheMenacheryLab’s lovely work on this - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03237-4

We also know that TMPRSS2 / FCS dependent “rapid”entry at cell surface is much better at escaping our complex & elegant cellular alarm defense system (interferon and interferon stimulated genes, aka “ISG’s”).

When you get rid of the FCS, the virus still does great—in fact grows better— on VERO cells (lack the ability to make interferon), but this SARS2 lacking the FCS is unable to efficiently infect lung cell models such as CALU-3, which can still make & receive interferon signals

So if you’re gonna study neutralization— and especially if you’re gonna make those kind of doomsday virus claims, I think you gotta use ACE2 + TMPRSS2 expressing target cells that mimic the entry pathway that drives the pandemic.

Furthermore.. no experiments in the entire preprint showed any kind of in vivo (animal infection) model of disease.""",pagkz7,ha5jxb0,RufusSG,2,covid19

While its certainly not enough to assume this is going to happen any day now, the fact that its at least theoretically possible is concerning, even if it might need some other simultaneous mutations to make it a viable variant.

In their experiment, they had to introduce 4 specific mutations to even make the variant that basically ignores current immunity, so its probably not something we have to worry about today. But with enough cases and high enough selective pressure, they could be accumulated, especially if they individually provide some evasion without significant cost, which seems to be something they suggest to be the case (figure 6)

Assuming its not a pseudovirus issue, I'm not sure a third doses will help much. 9 of the 12 antibodies they tested didn't really seem to bind at all and two of the other 3 were at like 40% of Delta binding (figure 6a).

There are data that seems strange to me as a layperson who doesn't read these kinds of studies, such as how common negative neutralization for the Delta 4+ is for antibodies or some of the non-dose dependent effects (ie: increasing titers lead to more negative neutralization to a point and then afterwards it causes neutralization).

As long as this pandemic goes virtually everyone said ADE is impossible, but here we have proof that it seems possible: Anti-NTD antibodies that enhance infection because of the shift in the NTD structure. This could be why Delta still is quite successful in vaccinated and convalescent people.

>Background

>SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus that causes the disease COVID-19. We have recently reported that androgens regulate the expression of SARS-CoV-2 host entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and androgen receptor (AR) in lung epithelial cells. We also demonstrated that the transcriptional repression of the AR enhanceosome inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.


>Methods

>To better understand the various sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and presence of host entry factors, we extensively characterized the tissue distribution and localization of SARS-CoV-2 virus, viral replication, and host entry factors in various anatomical sites sampled via autopsy. We applied RNA in-situ-hybridization (RNA-ISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) approaches. We also assessed histopathological changes in SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues.


>Results

>We detect SARS-CoV-2 virus and viral replication in pulmonary tissues by RNA-ISH and IHC and a variety of non-pulmonary tissues including kidney, heart, liver, spleen, thyroid, lymph node, prostate, uterus, and colon by qRT-PCR. We observe heterogeneity in viral load and viral cytopathic effects among various organ systems, between individuals and within the same patient. In a patient with a history of kidney transplant and under immunosuppressant therapy, we observe an unusually high viral load in lung tissue by RNA-ISH, IHC and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 virus is also detected in this patent’s kidney, liver and uterus. We find ACE2, TMPRSS2 and AR expression to overlap with the infection sites.

>Several factors may contribute to the induction of the platelet hyperreactive state described in COVID-19 (Figure 1).

>Figure 1. Platelet alterations in COVID-19 disease. As the SARS-Cov-2 infection progresses, the uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (1) may contribute to platelet activation resulting in increased exposure of P-selectin and Tissue Factor on the surface of circulating platelets.Platelet hyperreactivity may also be a consequence of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on megakaryocytes. This results in the production of activated platelets characterized by significant changes in their transcriptome (2). Diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, characterized di per se by a sustained platelet activation state, may determine the presence in circulation of COVID-19 patients, of “primed platelets” more prone to activation (3). In addition, the altered platelet activation can be a direct consequence of the virus activity that, once internalized, can determine a Toll like receptor 7-mediated release of platelet granules (4). Finally, activation of endothelial cells, which is another hallmarks of COVID-19 disease, may result in a NO pathway dysfunction (5) that can promote and sustain further platelet activation. These mechanisms, which are not reciprocally exclusive, are responsible for (a) an increase in circulating procoagulant platelets expressing Tissue Factor, which are therefore able to support thrombin generation, and P-selectin-positive platelets available for the formation of heteroaggregates with monocytes and neutrophils (b). The release of alpha and dense granule cargo as well as the production of extracellular vesicles are further consequences of platelet activation (c,d). The interaction between platelets and neutrophils causes the formation of highly prothrombotic NETs (e) that can support the formation of fibrin-rich microthrombi that have been shown in the lung of COVID-19 patients (f,g)",pabu3y,pabu3y,tozalo,1,covid19

“Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases.”

They also compared ct values: 

“Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases.”

Now, to add to this, from a paper posted on this sub earlier in regards to breakthrough cases in HCWs found here: 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262158v1

From the paper I linked: 

“Results The delta variant (B.1.617.2) was identified in the majority of cases. Despite similar Ct-values, we demonstrate lower probability of infectious virus detection in respiratory samples of vaccinated HCWs with breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated HCWs with primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, infectious virus was found in 68.6% of breakthrough infections and Ct-values decreased throughout the first 3 days of illness.”

I’m curious what would cause the reduced probability of infectious virus despite the similar/higher ct value. Anyone knowledgeable in this field that can explain this?",pa46wz,pa46wz,InInteraction,1,covid19
ha5yc8l,1629815178.0,manulemaboul,"Current theory is a strong neutralisation in the lungs leading to less virions being expelled through breathing. That also explains the breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals while the protection against moderate to severe cases remains; there's much more neutralisation in the lungs than in the upper airways. That's probably why the viral load at diagnostic is mostly the same as unvaccinated individuals, since it starts there and it's tested from a nasal cavity sample; but it very rarely evolves to a pneumonia. Delta reproduces so fast it temporarily outruns the neutralising antibodies in upper airways basically.

I don't like this study. Vaccines weren't as common when alpha was at is peak, so naturally less covid positive people would have been vaccinated. If the entire population were vaccinated against covid, 100% of cases woukd be from vaccinated. If 1 person in the population was vaccinated and hid in a bunker, vaccine would be 100% effective at mitigating risk or infection based on that one person. 
The more people vaccinated the better infromation we have on the efficacy of the vaccine. 


>suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases.

Delta causes is more virulent. Higher viral loads are seen across all parties. Lower impact does not equal no impact. 



>I’m curious what would cause the reduced probability of infectious virus despite the similar/higher ct value.

Reduced probability of infectious disease goes hand in hand with higher ct values. Ct values are based on pcr cycle threshold values. 

Each cycle increases test sensitivity i.e. you are more likely to reach a fluorescent signal that the sample was reactive.

If you have low viral load, like you had covid 3 weeks ago, but you kept increasing pcr cycles, you kight find remnant inactive but reactive to pcr viral particles ie ct value goes up.

ha4h1qg,1629778946.0,Donexodus,"CT values do not measure infectious, live virus.  They often correlate, but not necessarily.  The PCR is just measuring chopped up RNA.

It’s possible that because the vaccines give your immune system a head start, the CT (which is only the same for a brief window) is measuring a greater proportion of killed virus vs. live in vaccinated people, and almost entirely live virus in unvaccinated people.

ha35yjn,1629756591.0,psychiatrixx,"Abstract
COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with both acute and chronic disorders affecting the nervous system. 
Acute neurological disorders affecting patients with COVID-19 range widely from anosmia, stroke, encephalopathy/encephalitis, and seizures to Guillain-Barre Syndrome. 
Chronic neurological sequelae are less well defined although exercise intolerance, dysautonomia, pain, as well as neurocognitive and psychiatric dysfunctions are commonly reported. 
Molecular analyses of cerebrospinal fluid and neuropathological studies highlight both vascular and immunologic perturbations. 
Low levels of viral RNA have been detected in the brains of few acutely ill individuals. 
Potential pathogenic mechanisms in the acute phase include coagulopathies with associated cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury, blood-brain barrier abnormalities with endotheliopathy and possibly viral neuroinvasion accompanied by neuro-immune responses. 
Established diagnostic tools are limited by a lack of clearly defined COVID-19 specific neurological syndromes. 
Future interventions will require delineation of specific neurological syndromes, diagnostic algorithm development, and uncovering the underlying disease mechanisms that will guide effective therapies.",pa2ihf,pa2ihf,Tiger_Internal,1,covid19

A developing finding from the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in COVID-19 survivors. While studies have shown clinically significant rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and trauma-related symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after COVID-19, little is known about how these symptoms evolve over time. Here, we report findings from a cohort study of 52 participants recruited from the greater New York City area following acute COVID-19 infection. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety-related symptoms, the Insomnia Severity Scale (ISS) for sleep-related symptoms, and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) for trauma-related symptoms both at baseline and at long-term (24–60 weeks post-infection) follow-up. We found a high degree of correlation between psychiatric symptom scales within participants. More participants met established cutoffs for clinically significant insomnia and post-traumatic stress at follow-up compared to baseline. Symptom scales for depression, insomnia, and PTSD were increased at long-term follow-up, with only increased PCL-C scores surviving correction for multiple comparisons (Z ​= ​2.92, W ​= ​434, p ​= ​0.004). Our results present evidence from a small cohort that neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly those related to PTSD, may worsen over time in COVID-19 survivors. Future studies should continue to investigate these questions in broader populations, while additionally exploring the potential biological and sociological mechanisms that may contribute to neuropsychiatric pathology after COVID-19 infection.",p9q1mm,p9q1mm,afk05,1,covid19

1. They have a figure for unvaccinated positives that shows viral load increasing (infered from decreasing CT) for the first few days after symptom onset. Isn't this a change versus earlier reports? I recall charts showing viral loads peaking at the time of symtpom onset. Does Delta behave differently?

2. Their data show that vaccinated people need roughly 10X higher viral load than unvaccinated people to have the same chance of yeilding samples of virus that could be cultured.  This is potentially good news. It implies that the equivalency of CT values we've seen for breakthroughs versus unvaccinated cases isn't as bad as it sounds and that onward transmission might still be reduced .

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly effective at preventing COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. As no vaccine is 100% effective, breakthrough infections are expected to occur. We analyzed the virological characteristics of 161 vaccine breakthrough infections in a population of 24,706 vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs), using RT-PCR and virus culture. The delta variant (B.1.617.2) was identified in the majority of cases. Despite similar Ct-values, we demonstrate lower probability of infectious virus detection in respiratory samples of vaccinated HCWs with breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated HCWs with primary SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, infectious virus was found in 68.6% of breakthrough infections and Ct-values decreased throughout the first 3 days of illness. We conclude that rare vaccine breakthrough infections occur, but infectious virus shedding is reduced in these cases.",p9j8rd,p9j8rd,MummersFart,1,covid19

>In COVID-19, immune responses are key in determining disease severity. However, cellular mechanisms at the onset of inflammatory lung injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly involving endothelial cells, remain ill-defined. Using Syrian hamsters as a model for moderate COVID-19, we conduct a detailed longitudinal analysis of systemic and pulmonary cellular responses, and corroborate it with datasets from COVID-19 patients. Monocyte-derived macrophages in lungs exert the earliest and strongest transcriptional response to infection, including induction of pro-inflammatory genes, while epithelial cells show weak alterations. Without evidence for productive infection, endothelial cells react, depending on cell subtypes, by strong and early expression of anti-viral, pro-inflammatory, and T cell recruiting genes. Recruitment of cytotoxic T cells as well as emergence of IgM antibodies precede viral clearance at day 5 post infection. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters thus identifies cell type-specific effector functions, providing detailed insights into pathomechanisms of COVID-19 and informing therapeutic strategies.",p9h6mp,p9h6mp,tozalo,1,covid19

>Galectin 3-binding protein (Lgals3bp) gene stood out as being upregulated in many cell types from 2 dpi to 5 dpi (Fig. 3). Notably, we likewise measured increased levels of Lgals3bp protein in lungs (Fig. 2c), which was shown to be regulated also in plasma of COVID-19 patients and correlated with severity19.


Neutrophils


>As notable difference, strong induction of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines targeting CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) 2, such as CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL6, and CXCL8, were found only in human basal and secretory cells with severe COVID-19 but were absent in moderately-ill Syrian hamsters (Supplementary Fig. 6a, Fig. 3). Aside from the epithelial inductions of neutrophil-attractant transcripts unique to severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters and patients displayed strikingly similar pro-inflammatory immune profiles specifically in migratory myeloid cells.



Viral RNA


>By in situ-hybridization, we visualized SARS-CoV-2 RNA in bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 5b), and AT1 (Fig. 5c, arrowhead) and AT2 (Fig. 5c, arrow) cells, whereas endothelial cells were consistently devoid of virus (Fig. 5b, hash). Importantly, viral RNA was detected in high numbers of intrabronchial and intraalveolar macrophages (Fig. 5d, arrows) at early time points. A fraction of macrophages contained high loads of virus without cell debris, pointing toward uptake of cell-free virus (Fig. 5d, inset).

But it’s easy to ignore that benefits compound.

I certainly don't want this study to fuel the ""mask don't work crowd"" since that was never the authors intention.

Limitation 1:  They used olive oil as the base of exhalation aerosol mixture. This confuses me since respriatory aerosols are water based, this would impact how they then move through the humid air upon dispersal.  This is movement IRL will also be impacted by the humidity in the air and have both an impact on distance traveled and trajectory (whether the droplet gets heavy and falls or floats up high for extended periods of time.   Humid air will make water droplets grow heavy as water attaches to them and they will fall out faster.

Limitation 2: The masks tested weren't designed for oil mist use and the oil base could mess with the efficiency of filtration.  This is a pretty big flaw.  NIOSH has a special designation for oil proof filters for these environments. Now in the workplace a lot of these oil mists are going to contain VOCs that have solvent properties, but the hydrophobic nature of oil will be very different in interaction with the filter than water would.  If the olive oil is damaging the masks then it will interfere with the results.

Australia is currently experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks from infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants (B.1.617.2, AY.3). Analysis of the index case reveals a sub-consensus level of sequencing reads (~25%) that support a 17-nucleotide deletion in ORF7a (ORF7aΔ17del). ORF7aΔ17del induces a frameshift mutation in ORF7a, which truncates the peptide and potentially leads to reduced suppression of host restriction factor BST-2/CD317/Tetherin. Despite this, the mutation has rapidly become represented at the consensus level in subsequent cases: approximately 72% of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Australian outbreak possess ORF7aΔ17del, and 99.7% (1534/1538) of Delta genomes on GISAID with ORF7aΔ17del originate from the current Australian outbreak (5 August 2021). The global abundance of this mutation might be underestimated given the difficulty of variant calling software correctly calling insertion/deletions (indels), the common inability of phylogenetics software to take indels into account, and the tendency of GISAID to not release submissions that contain a frameshift mutation (unless specifically requested). Overall, the rapid increase of persistent ORF7aΔ17del variants is concerning, and suggests either a chance founder effect with a neutral mutation yet to be purged, or that the ORF7aΔ17del mutation provides a direct selective advantage.",p9bs1b,p9bs1b,Tiger_Internal,1,covid19

From what I could gather, the main problem is that it's not a longitudinal study - they did not directly compare participants before and after a covid infection. They just took a survey and then tried to estimate the participants' premorbid IQ through a model that however doesn't seem to be particularly strong and is based on quite a lot of vague factors such as gender. Additionally, they don't seem to address the fact that these socioeconomic factors that correlate with IQ might very well also correlate with the likelihood of catching covid - especially things like income. Also, given that this was taken in 2020, including during the first wave when a lot of cases went unnoticed due to lack of testing, the subset of people with a covid diagnosis is probably not random as well.

Even then, other respiratory viruses can cause cognitive deficits as the authors also acknowledge, so even if covid did it wouldn't be particularly surprising.

I think that the only conclusion you can factually draw from this study is: participants that got covid scored worse in an intelligence test compared to those who didn't. There seems to be no basis for causal links.

Finally, what's with this Great British Intelligence Test? I'm not from the UK and I had never heard of it before, so I tried to have a look at it and it doesn't seem much different from any non-standardized random intelligence test you might find online. It also seems to require a rather long attention span, which in itself might make the sample of those who complete it non-random. So I wonder, is this actually a useful test to evaluate cognitive abilities? And regardless of that, why don't just recruit a bunch of participants and have them take an *actual* IQ test?",p9alnl,p9alnl,dietcheese,1,covid19

h9w6qpl,1629626759.0,brushwithblues,">The efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against the Delta variant, which has been associated with greater transmissibility and virulence, remains unclear. We conducted a test-negative case-­control study to explore the vaccine efficacy (VE) in real-world settings. We recruited participants aged 18-59 years who consisted of SARS-CoV-2 test-positive cases (n=74) and test-negative controls (n=292) during the outbreak of the Delta variant in May 2021 in Guangzhou city, China. Vaccination status was compared to estimate the VE of SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines. A single dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine yielded the VE of only 13.8%. After adjusting for age and sex, the overall VE for two-dose vaccination was 59.0% (95% confidence interval: 16.0% to 81.6%) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 70.2% (95% confidence interval: 29.6% to 89.3%) against moderate COVID-19 and 100% against severe COVID-19 which might overestimate due to the small sample size. The VE of two-dose vaccination against COVID-19 reached 72.5% among participants aged 40-59 years, and was higher in females than in males against COVID-19 and moderate diseases. While single dose vaccination was not sufficiently protective, the two-dose dosing scheme of the inactivated vaccines was effective against the Delta variant infection in real-world settings, with the estimated efficacy exceeding the World Health Organization minimal threshold of 50%.",p99vkj,p99vkj,brushwithblues,1,covid19

Now I'm not a vaccine researcher- so maybe  they can correct me if I'm wrong here- but AB levels are not the expected outcome variable in vaccine studies.

I see this repeated a lot on Reddit and it isn’t accurate. Antibodies are made by plasma cells (which are a subset of B cells). As long as you have plasma cells, they’ll sit in your bone marrow and pump out antibodies. When your titers drop, it’s because those cells have died. 

Now like you were saying, you do still have memory B cells. But if you get infected than you need to 1) get the virus to where your B cells are (in the lymph nodes or spleen- not in the mucosal surfaces that are the first contact point for the virus) 2) differentiate into plasma cells- memory B cells don’t themselves make antibodies and 3) make enough antibodies to make a difference in your infection. This takes a couple of days. Antibodies are most useful against viruses when they’re already present at the time of infection, since viruses enter into your cells where the antibodies can’t get at them. So by the time you’ve actually made your secondary antibody response you’ve missed your window for them to be a real difference maker. 

Antibodies are the best correlate of protection for this vaccine (and most others as well). It’s absolutely appropriate for them to be looking into booster doses because of waning antibody titers.",p991gd,h9wdule,brushwithblues,2,covid19
h9zayw3,1629682177.0,jdorje,"Again,  the data suggests that breakthrough infections are serious and should not be ignored - 1.8% CFR in over-50's in the UK, only about 70% lower than in the unvaccinated.  Antibodies do not correlate to outcome in breakthroughs,  but they correlate strongly to breakthrough rates.

We end up with at least partially independent effects: reduction in infection chance and reduction in severity if infected.  The former relies on passive defenses,  i.e., antibodies.  The latter relies on active defenses,  i.e., humoral T and B cells.

It's the passive defenses where the most obvious gains are to be had. Bringing efficacy against infection from 60-80% back up to 94% is a 3-7 fold improvement in population-level outcomes. We do not have data on whether boosters will improve either humoral response or long-term antibody levels (number of circulating B cells).

The idea that boosters mean a failure of vaccines needs to end.  Measles and polio require a series of shots over many years.  Flu benefits from a new multivalent shot every year.  And no other respiratory disease has an effective vaccine at all yet.  If we're accepting that covid will be endemic then we're accepting that regular boosters will have value in reducing its public health burden.",p991gd,h9wdule,brushwithblues,2,covid19

ha049y7,1629699454.0,scientists-rule,"This article was referenced in a different topic on r/covid19 , now locked, with the Title:

""Study supports widespread use of better masks to curb COVID-19 indoors”

… but it does not.

There is little evidence that wearing a mask makes a difference … as the EU CDC describes it, “a small to moderate protective effect”. Perhaps that’s because of the fit issue … but the **real** conclusion of this post is found in the quote:
> The results also suggest that, while higher ventilation capacities are required to fully mitigate aerosol build-up, even relatively low air-change rates (2/hr) lead to lower aerosol build-up compared to the *best performing mask* in an unventilated space. (emphases added)",p8uj2n,p8uj2n,,1,covid19
hb1vv4b,1630414806.0,scientists-rule,"This is a late comment as I try to make sense of this, in light of the many other mask studies.

The article makes this specific claim:
> Furthermore, although the present study does not characterize the effectiveness of masks during inhalation, the aforementioned loss of filtration efficiency due to perimeter leakage is also expected to be present during inhalation, although it is to a lesser extent due to the improved sealing effect produced by the negative pressure difference relation to the ambient.

If one’s mask deforms on inhalation, then the seal is good … not perfect, but good. If one’s glasses fog upon exhalation, the seal is not very good. I propose that that may be why the [EU CDC ](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/using-face-masks-community-reducing-covid-19-transmission)could only find a ‘small to moderate protective effect’ from universal masking.

On both sides of the mask debate, this issue fails to be recognized:

""Tests show that masks do not work … only 10% "" … etc … fails to recognize that they may not be protecting others, but they may protect the wearer.

""Wear a mask - protect yourself, protect others"" … the former far more true than the latter.

There are many mask studies. The engineering ones show that perfectly sealed masks are reliable and work … the better ones (N95, FFP2, etc) work better. The epidemiological studies have a hard time finding confirmation. I believe the divergence of the two has to do with what appears to be a dramatic difference between inhalation filtration efficiency (as measured by the engineers) and exhalation efficiency (as measured by the epidemiologists.)

The conclusions of this particular post address exhalation specifically. That’s the ‘Protect others’ argument. Even with masks, we shed viral load if we are infected. It does not address whether a mask … or which mask … has a protective benefit.

Perhaps the answer to that will come as data from Germany (universal masking with FFP2 -94% capture at 1 micron) is compared to countries with lesser requirements … or none at all.

PS: I still believe the most valuable conclusion of this article is that moderate ventilation outperforms the best masks … when considering the ability of the mask to remove virons from the exhaling source … it does not suggest that the exhaling source is better protected on inhalation by ventilation than via a good mask.",p8uj2n,p8uj2n,,1,covid19

The CoVac-1 vaccine candidate is based on T-cell epitopes chosen to induce broad and potent T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 including long-lasting memory. This is supported by data in SARS-CoV-1 convalescents, where T-cell immunity persisted for up to 17 years

We conducted a Phase I open-label trial, including 36 participants aged 18 to 80 years, who received one single subcutaneous CoVAC-1 vaccination. The primary endpoint was safety analyzed until day 56

###### Findings

* Expected local granuloma formation was observed in all study subjects, while systemic reactogenicity was absent or mild. 

* The phenotype of CoVac-1-induced T cells resembles that acquired upon natural infection, but with a higher magnitude as compared to the SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response in human COVID‑19 convalescents. 

* Notably, the broad T-cell response induced by CoVac-1 remains unaffected by current SARS-CoV-2 VOC

###### Conclusion

> The safety and immunogenicity results of this trial indicate that CoVac-1 is a promising multi-peptide vaccine candidate for induction of superior SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity, which builds the basis for a presently ongoing Phase II study evaluating CoVac-1 in patients with congenital or acquired B-cell deficiency, including cancer patients after B-cell-depleting therapy and disease-related immunoglobulin deficiency 

> CoVac-1 may well serve as a (complementary) vaccine candidate to induce T-cell immunity, particularly in elderly and immunocompromised individuals with impaired ability to mount sufficient immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with the currently approved vaccines.",p8qs2z,p8qs2z,SparePlatypus,1,covid19

I'm also curious how phase 3 efficacy trials will work since it'd be hard to separate the effect of T-cells from antibodies in immune competent trial subjects.

Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions was 55.5% (46.5% to 62.9%) and against deaths was 61.2% (48.9% to 70.5%) at ≥14 days after the second dose. Vaccine effectiveness ≥14 days after the second dose was highest for the youngest age group (70-74 years)—59.0% (43.7% to 70.2%) against symptomatic disease, 77.6% (62.5% to 86.7%) against hospital admissions, and 83.9% (59.2% to 93.7%) against deaths—and declined with increasing age.  


**Conclusions** Vaccination with CoronaVac was associated with a reduction in symptomatic covid-19, hospital admissions, and deaths in adults aged ≥70 years in a setting with extensive transmission of the gamma variant. Vaccine protection was, however, low until completion of the two dose regimen, and vaccine effectiveness was observe to decline with increasing age among this elderly population.

> A subset of events within the UK Government Events Research Programme (ERP), developed to examine the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from attendance at events, was examined to explore the public health impact of holding mass sporting events. The events were part of the ERP. This additional public health analysis from routine contact tracing data was not part of the pre-registered protocols and analysed as part of daily public health analysis.

> We used contact tracing data routinely collected through telephone interviews and online
 questionnaires, recording postcodes and location types attended in the potentially
 infectious (day -2 to day 0) and potentially acquired (day -3 to day -7) time periods, to
 describe the potential public health impact of the large sporting and cultural events on
 potential transmission and incidence of COVID-19.

> Data from the EURO 2020 matches hosted at Wembley identified very high numbers of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and were traced through NHS Test and Trace. This included both individuals who were potentially infectious (3,071) and those who acquired their infection during the time of the tournament (6,784). This is in contrast with the All England Lawn Tennis Championships at Wimbledon (and other events), where there were similar number of spectators and venue capacity but there were lower total numbers of potentially infectious cases (299) and potentially acquired cases (582).

> While the infections associated with the EURO 2020 event may be attributed to a set of circumstances (once in a generation experience for many) which are unlikely to be replicated for the forthcoming sporting season, other aspects may be important to consider including mitigations for spectators to consider such as face coverings when travelling to and from events, minimising crowding in poorly ventilated indoors spaces such as bars and pubs where people may congregate to watch events. It is also important to minimise the risk of transmission from aerosol exposure related to singing and chanting in large groups by improving ventilation in enclosed spaces.",p8cocd,p8cocd,Northlumberman,1,covid19

Background: Indoor aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized, especially in schools where children remain in close proximity and largely unvaccinated. Measures such as strategic natural ventilation and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration remain poorly implemented and mask mandates are often progressively lifted as vaccination rollout is enhanced. Methods: We adapted a previously developed aerosol transmission model to study the effect of interventions (natural ventilation, face masks, HEPA filtration, and their combinations) on the concentration of virus particles in a classroom of 160 m3 containing one infectious individual. The cumulative dose of viruses absorbed by exposed occupants was calculated. Results: The most effective single intervention was natural ventilation through the full opening of six windows all day during the winter (14-fold decrease in cumulative dose), followed by the universal use of surgical face masks (8-fold decrease). In the spring/summer, natural ventilation was only effective (≥ 2-fold decrease) when windows were fully open all day. In the winter, partly opening two windows all day or fully opening six windows at the end of each class was effective as well (≥ 2-fold decrease). Opening windows during yard and lunch breaks only had minimal effect (≤ 1.2-fold decrease). One HEPA filter was as effective as two windows partly open all day during the winter (2.5-fold decrease) while two filters were more effective (4-fold decrease). Combined interventions (i.e., natural ventilation, masks, and HEPA filtration) were the most effective (≥ 30-fold decrease). Combined interventions remained highly effective in the presence of a super-spreader. Conclusions: Natural ventilation, face masks, and HEPA filtration are effective interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission. These measures should be combined and complemented by additional interventions (e.g., physical distancing, hygiene, testing, contact tracing, and vaccination) to maximize benefit. ",p8bmuw,p8bmuw,Tiger_Internal,1,covid19

Looking down the line, we would absolutely expect, much like Whittaker, more changes to this furin recognition site.

hbezxau,1630650078.0,rainbow658,"Summary

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is generally milder than in adults, but a proportion of cases result in hyperinflammatory conditions often including myocarditis.
Methods

To better understand these cases, we applied a multiparametric approach to the study of blood cells of 56 children hospitalized with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma cytokine and chemokine levels and blood cellular composition were measured, alongside gene expression at the bulk and single-cell levels.
Findings

The most severe forms of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to SARS-CoV-2 that resulted in myocarditis were characterized by elevated levels of pro-angiogenesis cytokines and several chemokines. Single-cell transcriptomics analyses identified a unique monocyte/dendritic cell gene signature that correlated with the occurrence of severe myocarditis characterized by sustained nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) signaling and associated with decreased gene expression of NF-κB inhibitors. We also found a weak response to type I and type II interferons, hyperinflammation, and response to oxidative stress related to increased HIF-1α and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling.

They compared them with other ""normal healthy"" men as controls.

They make some fuss about men who may want to conceive needing to be concerned... but as it stands their median age was 40 and went up to 70. I don't think the men in this study are particularly concerned about conception.

How severity factors into the disease or the age of the patients or any comorbidity makes a difference, we won't know from this data.

They mention five men who got an additional sperm analysis after 3 months. There was no statistical difference. But I took a peek at the supplemental data. They had so few follow up patients that they had space to give individual results.

One patient had a near zero sperm count initially, then a much higher (but still lowish) count after three months. Sperm concentration varied widely, some halving over the 3 months and another doubling.

Men were asked to abstain from sexual activity for 2 days before giving a sample. Given the data I'm not sure how well this was adhered to.

Finally, these tests were done by mailing of specimens. According to supplemental data, a couple of the men gave in person samples at some point. Not sure if the controls had to mail their sperm too.

h9m7uze,1629428335.0,MummersFart,"Objectives: 
This observational study evaluated the impact of return-to-play protocols to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a youth ice hockey programme in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Methods: 
Following an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in November 2020, a COVID-19 Response Team evaluated the epidemiological data to identify transmission dynamics and develop enhanced protocols to prevent transmission. During the subsequent 18-week study period, incident cases were investigated to identify the likely transmission source; testing, quarantine and isolation recommendations were provided to families in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Results: 
Simple but stringent protocols were implemented among 148 youth ice hockey players ages 6–18. Players were required to arrive at the rink in full gear; locker rooms were closed, building entry was limited to one parent per player, and masks were required at all times except for players on the ice. Following implementation of the enhanced protocols, more than 500 practices and games were completed with at least 15 858 athlete-hours of exposure and no within-programme COVID-19 transmission was detected despite high community incidence and sporadic household exposures.

Conclusion: 
This study suggests indoor youth sports can operate safely with appropriate protocols in place, even within communities of high COVID-19 transmission, even when athletes are not yet vaccinated or wearing masks during play. Transmission appears to be more likely in congested indoor areas involving adults than on the ice during play. Protocols should be developed in collaboration with programme participants. Strong collaboration in the interest of youth sports can motivate adoption of protocols which prevent within-team transmission.",p7to0p,p7to0p,MummersFart,1,covid19

By combining plasma-selected spike substitutions, we generated synthetic ‘polymutant’ spike proteins that resisted polyclonal antibody neutralization to a similar degree as currently circulating variants of concern (VOC). Importantly, by aggregating VOC-associated and plasma-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, **we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike are sufficient to confer near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescents and mRNA vaccine recipients.

h9l9emd,1629412044.0,yaolilylu,"Lots of interesting info in this article, particularly these paragraphs:

""Immune escape is so worrying because it could force humanity to update its vaccines continually, as happens for flu. Yet the vaccines against many other diseases—measles, polio, and yellow fever, for example—have remained effective for decades without updates, even in the rare cases where immune-evading variants appeared. “There was big alarm around 2000 that maybe we’d need to replace the hepatitis B vaccines,” because an escape variant had popped up, Read says. But the variant has not spread around the world: It is able to infect close contacts of an infected person, but then peters out. The virus apparently faces a trade-off between transmissibility and immune escape. Such trade-offs likely exist for SARS-CoV-2 as well.

Some clues about SARS-CoV-2’s future path may come from coronaviruses with a much longer history in humans: those that cause common colds. Some are known to reinfect people, but until recently it was unclear whether that’s because immunity in recovered people wanes, or because the virus changes its surface to evade immunity. In a study published in April in PLOS Pathogens, Bloom and other researchers compared the ability of human sera taken at different times in the past decades to block virus isolated at the same time or later. They showed that the samples could neutralize strains of a coronavirus named 229E isolated around the same time, but weren’t always effective against virus from 10 years or more later. The virus had evidently evolved to evade human immunity, but it had taken 10 years or more.

“Immune escape conjures this catastrophic failure of immunity when it is really immune erosion,” Bloom says. “Right now it seems like SARS-CoV-2, at least in terms of antibody escape, is actually behaving a lot like coronavirus 229E.” 

Others are probing SARS-CoV-2 itself. In a preprint published this month, researchers tinkered with the virus to learn how much it has to change to evade the antibodies generated in vaccine recipients and recovered patients. **They found that it took 20 changes to the spike protein to escape current antibody responses almost completely.** That means the bar for complete escape is high, says one of the authors, virologist Paul Bieniasz of Rockefeller University. “But it’s very difficult to look into a crystal ball and say whether that is going to be easy for the virus to acquire or not,” he says.""",p7m27y,p7m27y,icloudbug,1,covid19

> We investigated the presence of virus in size-fractioned aerosols from six COVID-19 patients admitted into mixed acuity wards in April of 2020.  

> **Methods**  

> Size-fractionated aerosol samples and aerosol size distributions were collected from COVID-19 positive patients.

> **Methods**   

> The first 15 participants were enrolled, in groups of 5, to receive two doses, separated by 21 days, of one of three dose concentrations, administered intramuscularly. 138 further participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive the same 3 dose concentrations, in a double blinded manner. Primary outcomes were solicited adverse reactions 7 days after each vaccination and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres (GMT) against SARS-CoV-2, 2 weeks after the second vaccination (day 36), measured by live microneutralisation assay against wild-type virus (MNA50). Secondary outcomes included unsolicited adverse events, and humoral and cellular responses at day 36, measured by IgG ELISA against Spike protein and interferon-γ secreting T-cells by ELISpot stimulated with multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

> The effectiveness of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and mRNA-1273 vaccines against new SARS-CoV-2 infections requires continuous re-evaluation, given the increasingly dominant Delta variant. We investigated the effectiveness of the vaccines in a large community-based survey of randomly selected households across the UK. We found that the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAd0x1 against any infections (new PCR positives) and infections with symptoms or high viral burden is reduced with the Delta variant. A single dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had similar or greater effectiveness compared to a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. Effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positives but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher among those vaccinated following a prior infection and younger adults. With Delta, infections occurring following two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden to those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with Delta.

I hadn't seen this posted here before, so I thought I'd post it as it seems to be very relevant to the hot-topic of booster doses, etc.",p7ahki,p7ahki,hu6Bi5To,1,covid19
h9if694,1629363094.0,RufusSG,"Cheers, lots of fascinating bits and pieces in here. A few of my notes, obviously much more on top of this:

* Pfizer is more effective initially but seems to wane more quickly, and in the medium-term they end up about the same.
* One dose of Moderna seems significantly more effective than a single dose of the other two vaccines (AZ 34%, Pfizer 58%, Moderna 76% for the immune naive).
* If you've been previously infected, definitely get vaccinated: VE against symptoms for the previously infected was estimated at 94% for AZ and 99% for Pfizer (88% and 93% respectively for all infections). Linked to the previous point, a single dose of Moderna for the previously infected has estimated VE against symptoms of 100%!
* This whole bit:

>There was no evidence that the effectiveness of two ChAdOx1 vaccinations ≥14 days previously in preventing new PCR-positives differed from the protection afforded by previous natural infection without vaccination (heterogeneity p=0.33), whereas two BNT162b2 vaccinations afforded greater protection (p=0.04).",p7ahki,h9ibrmd,hu6Bi5To,2,covid19
h9jkdrn,1629386875.0,large_pp_smol_brain,"Interesting, this is the first thing I’ve seen suggesting protection against reinfection isn’t very high, after being previously infected. I’ve posted all the reinfection studies many times before so I won’t paste them again here (unless someone asks), but in another thread I was given [this](https://i.imgur.com/8Z0PATa.jpg) plot from the UK, which shows a pretty constant ratio of reinfections to first infections, which kind of casts doubt on the theory that Delta would be causing more reinfections. But this paper claims only a ~75-80% protection against reinfection. Very interesting.

Will have to wait for more data. Of course they can’t be sure they’re looking at reinfections since they aren’t sequencing AFAIK, but the fact still remains that the chances of testing PCR positive appear to be higher than expected.

Edit: I thought of a potential issue here. [this research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2776810) Suggests that the risk of a PCR positive is elevated for a lot longer than 14 days after being infected. Therefore, the fact that they measured after 14 days could lead to some persistent RNA shedding causing positives",p7ahki,p7ahki,hu6Bi5To,1,covid19
h9k1902,1629393746.0,playthev,"Remember they are testing at regular intervals even if asymptomatic in this trial (like in the SIREN study). The protection against symptomatic disease is decent for delta at 82%. But even coming to symptomatic infections, you can note that in terms of the symptoms, the reinfections also have [less typical](https://i.imgur.com/QoDlPJF.jpg) covid symptoms than vaccine breakthrough infections, it would have been even better if they added hospitalisation statistics.

Also in this study, people weren't censored after testing positive to my knowledge (please correct me if I missed it), thus if the vaccinees tested positive post first dose, they then have a 120 day window where they aren't counted to have reinfections, so the post dose 2 efficacy could well look better than it really is.",p7ahki,h9jkdrn,large_pp_smol_brain,2,covid19

h9jlnvt,1629387399.0,playthev,"Interesting, efficacy against all disease is similar in alpha and delta periods, but certainly for CT<30 and symptomatic infections, efficacy is lower in the delta Vs alpha period. I will say that in the alpha period (1 Dec 2020 to 17May 2021, it is likely that vaccine effectiveness is overestimated because the bulk of people who were fully vaccinated would have study time primarily in the [latter part of the study period](https://i.imgur.com/YDJPBev.jpg). We know that cases dropped significantly [during this time period.](https://i.imgur.com/m6Lexgp.jpg) Thus it is possible that the differences in infection rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated are also due to differences in exposure, not just due to the vaccine efficacy. This is less likely to be an issue in the delta period.

Also Pfizer efficacy seems to wane faster than AZ efficacy, even if it remains higher until the end of the study period. Prior infection mediated immunity overlaps with the AZ and Pfizer, but is closer to Pfizer. Reinfections have less typical covid symptoms than vaccine breakthrough infections, but again due to wide confidence intervals, overlap with the vaccine breakthrough infections.

We observe stable antibody levels over 11 months in individuals who recovered from COVID19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our data revealed higher-than recovered levels from naive individuals vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and similar-to recovered levels from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) recipients. For all vaccines, inoculation after recovery resulted in higher antibody levels than vaccination alone. Responses to Pfizer and Moderna vaccines decreased over time from high initial levels but at the time of publication remain higher than those for recovered or J&J recipients.

>The CVnCoV (CureVac) mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has recently been evaluated in a phase 2b/3 efficacy trial in humans. CV2CoV is a second-generation mRNA vaccine with optimized non-coding regions and enhanced antigen expression. Here we report a head-to-head study of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV in nonhuman primates. We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques with two doses of 12 ug of lipid nanoparticle formulated CVnCoV, CV2CoV, or sham (N=6/group). CV2CoV induced substantially higher binding and neutralizing antibodies, memory B cell responses, and T cell responses as compared with CVnCoV. CV2CoV also induced more potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and C.37 (lambda). While CVnCoV provided partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, CV2CoV afforded robust protection with markedly lower viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Antibody responses correlated with protective efficacy. These data demonstrate that optimization of non-coding regions can greatly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in nonhuman primates.",p74d76,p74d76,acronymforeverything,1,covid19

CoV-2 vaccination; most NH residents received BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination under the Emergency Use Authorization due to first to market and its availability. With NH residents poor initial vaccine response, the rise of NH breakthrough infections and outbreaks, characterization of the durability of immunity to inform public health policy on the need for boosting is needed. We report on humoral immunity from 2 weeks to 6-months post-vaccination in 120 NH residents and 92 ambulatory healthcare worker controls with and without pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and serum neutralization titers, were assessed using a bead-based ELISA method and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Anti-spike, anti-RBD and neutralization levels dropped more than 80% over 6 months time in all groups irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 months post-vaccine, 72% of the infection-naive NH residents had neutralization titers at or below the lower limit of detection compared to 16% at 2 weeks after full vaccination. These data demonstrate a significant reduction in levels of antibody in all groups. In particular, those infection-naive NH residents had lower initial post-vaccination humoral immunity immediately and exhibited the greatest declines 6 months later. Healthcare workers, given their younger age and relative good-health, achieved higher initial antibody levels and better maintained them, yet also experienced significant declines in humoral immunity. Based on the rapid spread of the delta variant and reports of vaccine breakthrough in NH and among younger community populations, boosting NH residents may be warranted.",p6yq5m,p6yq5m,icloudbug,1,covid19

Children have reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection rates and a substantially lower risk for developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 compared with adults. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying protection in younger age groups remain unknown.  
 Here we characterize the single-cell transcriptional landscape in the upper airways of SARS-CoV-2-negative (n = 18) and age-matched SARS-CoV-2-positive (n = 24) children and corresponding samples from adults (n = 44), covering an age range of 4 weeks to 77 years. Children displayed higher basal expression of relevant pattern recognition receptors such as MDA5 (IFIH1) and RIG-I (DDX58) in upper airway epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, resulting in stronger innate antiviral responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection than in adults.    


 We further detected distinct immune cell subpopulations including KLRC1 (NKG2A)+ cytotoxic T cells and a CD8+ T cell population with a memory phenotype occurring predominantly in children. Our study provides evidence that the airway immune cells of children are primed for virus sensing, resulting in a stronger early innate antiviral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection than in adults.",p6sc4x,p6sc4x,rek-me-reksai,1,covid19

And that if those immune responses do not develop during childhood through normal exposure to a variety of pathogens, then the risk of more severe responses after puberty increases significantly.

Two examples I can think of are: 
- the prevalence of Epstein Barr antibodies in urban populations vs suburban
- the adverse long term effects of chicken pox in children vs shingles in adults

If the above is considered to be medical 'common knowledge' then why would masking children, especially young children (who do not have comorbidities) be considered an optimal long-term public health policy?",p6sc4x,p6sc4x,rek-me-reksai,1,covid19

h9fdn1l,1629305286.0,tozalo,"Although protection in upper-airway would help, I think we also need something to protect us from virus directly hitting lower airway (because of higher virus titre, larger air volume inhaled especially via mouth, etc).


Different inhalers that may reach lung were in development, but I don't know what's going on, now. ex. HSPG inhaler


Also, with Delta and some other variants, we may have to recheck and relearn many aspects of Covid as MDs are reporting different disease progression. I think we need to keep in our mind the possibility that some of what we have learned with Covid-Classic may not be applicable. 


So, I think the best protection method that works right now, without any delay, is good enough mask (at least N95 or equivalent with good fit) and eye-protection (to be prudent).


Vaccination may help, but it takes time. So, we should be insisting on the use of good mask with proper fitting as the immediate and primary mean to reduce current surge.

h9h1eyf,1629332483.0,Smooth_Imagination,">Following virus sensing, signaling through IRF3/NFκB leads to the expression of primary antiviral effectors, as well as antiviral cytokines such as IFNβ and IFNλ (Fig. 2a). IFNs act on epithelial cells in an autocrine and paracrine manner, further increasing MDA5/LGP2 responsiveness in the tissue and inducing a broad range of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). While we were not able to detect the expression of type I and type III IFNs themselves, ISGs showed an impressive activation pattern in epithelial cells of SARS-CoV-2-positive children, including many genes previously shown to exhibit strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, such as LY6E (ref. 18), IFITM2 and BST2 (ref. 19). In all epithelial cells, and in particular in ciliated cells, the magnitude of ISG expression considerably surpassed that of infected adults in both the early and late infection phases (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3) with a generally decreasing trend in the late phase (Extended Data Fig. 3).

This is in some aspects similar to what is reported in bats, which are generally able to effectively tolerate many extremely nasty viruses.

They have a strong interferon early response and it appears also differences in toll like receptors (that may diminish some of the immune cell mediated invasive responses which may induce collateral damage), and a more efficient linkage between the interferon signalling and the internal antiviral mechanisms within the cells which block viral replication, such as via activation of RNase l.

**Abstract**  
The autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) comprises four entities, including the postvaccination phenomenon, which appears after being exposed to adjuvants in vaccines that increase the immune response. There is limited information about autoimmune endocrine diseases and ASIA after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination.  
  
**Patient's Findings:** Two female health care workers received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and three days later developed clinical manifestations of thyroid hyperactivity, with increased thyroid hormone levels on thyroid function tests, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and elevated antithyroid antibodies.   
  
**Summary:** Vaccines have been shown to trigger an immune response that leads to a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease. Our patients met the diagnostic criteria for ASIA; they were exposed to an adjuvant (vaccine), and they developed clinical manifestations of thyroid hyperfunction within a few days, with the appearance of antithyroid antibodies, despite being healthy before vaccination. 
  
**Conclusion:** Graves' disease can occur after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

The  Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly replaced the previously dominant variants, including Alpha, which is it self~60% more transmissible than the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (40-42). Delta thus appears to have acquired enhanced capacity for propagating in human   cells.   Several   hypotheses   have   been   proposed   to   explain   its   heighten transmissibility,  including mutations  in  the  RBD enhancing receptor engagement(43),P681R substitution near the S1/S2 boundary leading to more efficient furin cleavage(44, 45), and changes in its RNA polymerase increasing viral replication. We can not rule out the  possibility  that  mutations  in  the  viral  replication  machinery  unique  to  the  Delta variant (e.g. G671S in nsp12) may greatly increase the production of genomic RNA, but viral  assembly  into  mature  virions would require  many  other  factors  to  achieve the >1,000  fold  greater viral  load in  infected  patients.  We  have  not  detected  any  significant increase  in  ACE2  binding  by  either  the  full-length  Delta  S  trimer  or  its  RBD  fragment, nor  have we  observed  more  efficient  cleavage  in  the  Delta  S  than  any  other  variants.Indeed,  the  P681R  mutation  is  also  present  in  the  Kappa  variant,  which  appears  to  have impaired  furin  cleavage,  at  least,  in  HEK293  cells  used  in  our experiments.We  have identified two  properties, apparently  unique  to the  Delta  variant among  those  that  have been  studied  so  far,  that  might  possibly  account for  its  unusual  transmissibility.  First, when the Delta S protein is expressed on the cell surface at a saturating level, those cells fuse  more  efficiently  with target  cells  that producelow  levels  of  ACE2  than do  cells  of any  other  variant,  including  previously  characterized  Alpha  and  Beta (26). When the ACE2  expression  level  increases,  the  differences  among  the  variants  diminish. Second, the pseudoviruses containing the Delta S construct enter the ACE2-expressing target cells substantially more rapidly than other variants. These data suggest that the Delta S protein has  evolved  to  optimize  the  fusion  step  for  entering  cells  expressing  low  levels  of  the receptor. This  optimization  may  explain  why  the  Delta  variant  can  transmit  upon relatively  brief  exposure  and  infect  many  more  host  cells  rapidly, leading  to  a  short incubation  period  and greater  viral  load  during  the  infection...",p6lcav,p6lcav,icloudbug,1,covid19

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is known to induce antibodies that recognize also variants of concerns (VoCs) of the virus. However, epidemiological and laboratory evidences indicate that these antibodies have a reduce neutralization ability against VoCs. We studied binding and neutralizing antibodies against the Spike RBD and S2 domains of the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus and its alpha and beta VoCs and of seasonal betacoronaviruses (HKU1 and OC43) in a cohort of 31 health care workers vaccinated with BNT162b2-Comirnaty and prospectively followed post-vaccination. The study of sequential samples collected up to 64 days post-vaccination showed that serological assays measuring IgG against Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens were a poor proxy for VoCs neutralization. In addition, in subjects who had asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 prior to vaccination the loss of nAbs following disease can be rapid and protection from re-infection post-vaccination is often no better than in naïve subjects. Interestingly, in health care workers naïve for SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination induced a rapid and transient reactivation of pre-existing seasonal coronaviruses IgG responses that was associated with a subsequent reduced ability to neutralize some VoCs.

Abstract

This study is an experimental research utilizing a group with a pre-test and post-test design that is aimed to examine the results of nasal irrigation using a neti pot in patients with allergic rhinitis and the assessments of the patients’ satisfaction.  The subjects comprised of 30 patients, between 20 - 60 years of age, seen at the ear, nose, and  throat department of the HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center. A Visual - Analog Rating Scale (VAS) was used for testing sensory levels and to select and analyze the data The research results are as follows: 1. nasal irrigation with a neti pot in patients with allergic rhinitis and when comparing results before and after the procedure; nasal congestion symptoms were (5.47 + 1.76) and (2.77 + 2.25), itch symptoms were (4.40 + 3.10) and (1.73 + 1.95), sneeze symptoms (4.37 + 3.05) and (2.17 + 2.35), and nasal secretions (4.83 + 3.09) and (2.43 + 2.63). There was a significant difference at the 0.05 level and no complications were experienced during nasal irrigation or post irrigation.  2. The mean scores of nasal irrigation with the neti pot had shown results of “very satisfied”. As a result, nasal irrigation with a neti pot is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with allergic rhinitis there are no previous reports of this method that have been done here in Thailand.",p67x7c,h9c6oel,kenutbar,2,covid19

h9ce4h6,1629239707.0,Dutchnamn,"A nasal vaccine which is in development is the logical answer. Innate immunity can also be raised, some old school vaccines might help like polio, but what I find interesting are immune stimulants like bacterial lysates such as broncho vaxom. Of course it would be possible to lower the viral load in the nose using iodine solution nasal rinse, a nitric oxide promoting nasal spray, carrageenan spray and maybe a xylitol nasal spray. There are different amounts of evidence for each of those.

A whole different group without any evidence I know of are the more generic immune modulators. Again I don't know if these would work, but they are interesting in the scope of the question. Pidotimod, thymosin alpha and inosine pranobex are a few I can think of.

h9doanq,1629265248.0,SparePlatypus,"In theory it should. This has been hypothesized previously by researchers:

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/humidity-masks-may-lessen-severity-covid-19

Both cold temperature and low humidity (e.g breathing dry air in winter from artificial heating) affect the nacal mucosal environment in a negative way and are proposed to be one factor behind seasonality of respiratory illnesses. Studies have shown that increasing humidity levels in school classrooms for example results in lower incidence of respiratory viral infections like influenza A. 

Below is a study from Yale researchers on Rhinovirus that showed that the 'old wives tale' that cold air exposure is more likely to result in getting sick actually has a scientific basis : 

[Temperature-dependent innate defense against the common cold virus limits viral replication at warm temperature in mouse airway cells
](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/3/827)

Essentially, humidity aside two important tools - a set of sensors that detect infection and chemicals that co-ordinate the immune response - were also less effective at cooler temperatures. 

This and other factors that may result in poorer nasal immunity are explored [here, section 5](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445)",p67x7c,h9cq025,Heavy-Lingonberry473,2,covid19
h9b7ka5,1629219704.0,SparePlatypus,"> The clinical picture of COVID-19 varies widely. Many SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals have upper respiratory symptoms only, indicating that local immunity can constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx. A study in Cell by Ziegler et al. investigated early intrinsic immune responses by single-cell RNA-seq of nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 individuals, including 35 who were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. In patients with mild-to-moderate disease, epithelial cells expressed antiviral and interferon-responsive genes. 

> These responses were muted in individuals with severe COVID-19, despite equivalent viral loads. Severe disease was also characterized by the mucosal recruitment of highly inflammatory myeloid populations. The authors mapped viral tropism to specific epithelial cell subsets and defined host pathways that were linked with susceptibility or resistance. Overall, their study suggests that failed nasal epithelial antiviral immunity underlies severe COVID-19 and that host responses in the nasal mucosa are an essential determinant of the overall disease trajectory.

h9dw2hj,1629271935.0,SparePlatypus,"I'm interested in that topic myself,
there is evidence to suggest vaping or smoking may harm immune function or potentially increase susceptibility to infection, here for example:

[Chronic E-Cigarette Aerosol Inhalation Alters the Immune State of the Lungs and Increases ACE2 Expression, Raising Concern for Altered Response and Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34122126/)

> The receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, ACE2, was found to have moderate upregulation in mice exposed to unflavored vape pens, and further upregulation (six-fold) with JUUL mint aerosol exposure.

However this study goes on to say:

>  No changes were found in mice exposed to unflavored Mod device-generated aerosols.

Note: It's previously established Menthol has specific affects on immune state.
Whilst seperate animal models suggest vaping in general can enhance COVID disease progression-- more relevantly we  have paradoxical &, consistent real world data that shows current smokers and to lesser degree vapers seem to be at *lower* likelihood of infection, and are not at risk of heightened disease progression (when properly evaluated) perhaps even at lower risk: 

[Electronic Cigarette Use Is Not Associated with COVID-19 Diagnosis ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21501327211024391)

We know that hydration of the nasal passages are important, and vaping is essentially humidifying the upper respiratory tract-  In addition the core ingredients VG/PG (sans flavorings) and nicotine separately have established antiviral properties.  The data we have on on those that vape vs smoke is smaller and lower quality, however it preliminarily seems to suggest that smoking is more 'protective' than vaping.

 Overall the topic is quite contentious and poorly evaluated especially with vaping. There are some inaccurate reporting, dubious studies around this subject even by reliable sources,  Unsurprisingly perhaps -- as encouraging smoking or vaping has wider negative health effects beyond pandemic; we can't really draw firm conclusions yet.

* Live attenuated vaccine candidates are made by recoding the SARS-CoV-2 genome

* The lead vaccine candidate sCPD9 is virtually apathogenic in two hamster species

* Vaccination with sCPD9 elicits strong neutralizing antibody responses

* A single intranasal droplet vaccination induces sterilizing immunity in hamsters

The vaccine covered here in preclinical study is a similar design to codagenixs  live attenuated nasal vaccine covi vac, which is further ahead than this, having completed dosing in phase 1 human trials (although that also deletes furin cleavage site)

Most interesting segment to me is here; 

> Unexpectedly, despite weaker replication in Vero E6 cells, the recoded viruses sCPD9 and sCPD10 replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract on day 3 after vaccination (in fact, the quantity of detected RNA copies in  nasoropharyngeal swabs was comparable among all recoded viruses (and is also comparable to the viral loads of the WT virus in mock-infected animals on day 3 after challenge (

> These results indicate that all recoded viruses replicated with comparable efficiency in the upper respiratory tract of infected animals, although the viruses showed markedly different replication capacity in cultured Vero E6 cells .

For sure, there's some proportion of people looking for non-mRNA or adenoviral vectored vaccines, in addition needlephobia in the literature has been signalled to be a prominent component toward vaccine hesitancy.

h9ab4gi,1629206037.0,Bifobe,"Summary:  

> **Background**  

> Bell's palsy is a rare adverse event reported in clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines. However, to our knowledge no population-based study has assessed the association between the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and Bell's palsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of Bell's palsy after BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccination.  

> **Methods**  

> In this case series and nested case-control study done in Hong Kong, we assessed the risk of Bell's palsy within 42 days following vaccination with BNT162b2 (Fosun–BioNTech [equivalent to Pfizer–BioNTech]) or CoronaVac (from Sinovac Biotech, Hong Kong) using data from voluntary surveillance reporting with the Hospital Authority, the COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Event Online Reporting system for all health-care professionals, and the Hospital Authority's territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. We described reported cases of Bell's palsy among vaccine recipients (aged 18–110 years for CoronaVac and aged 16–110 years for BNT162b2). We compared the estimated age-standardised incidence of clinically confirmed cases among individuals who had received the CoronaVac or BNT162b2 vaccination (up to 42 days before presentation) with the background incidence in the population. A nested case-control study was also done using conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for risk of Bell's palsy and vaccination. Cases and controls were matched (1:4) by age, sex, admission setting, and admission date.  

> **Findings**  

> Between February 23 and May 4, 2021, 451 939 individuals received the first dose of CoronaVac and 537 205 individuals received the first dose of BNT162b2. 28 clinically confirmed cases of Bell's palsy were reported following CoronaVac and 16 cases were reported following BNT162b2. The age-standardised incidence of clinically confirmed Bell's palsy was 66·9 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 37·2 to 96·6) following CoronaVac vaccination and 42·8 per 100 000 person-years (19·4 to 66·1) for BNT162b2 vaccination. The age-standardised difference for the incidence compared with the background population was 41·5 (95% CI 11·7 to 71·4) for CoronaVac and 17·0 (−6·6 to 40·6) for BNT162b2, equivalent to an additional 4·8 cases per 100 000 people vaccinated for CoronaVac and 2·0 cases per 100 000 people vaccinated for BNT162b2. In the nested case-control analysis, 298 cases were matched to 1181 controls, and the adjusted ORs were 2·385 (95% CI 1·415 to 4·022) for CoronaVac and 1·755 (0·886 to 3·477) for BNT162b2.  

> **Interpretation**  

> Our findings suggest an overall increased risk of Bell's palsy after CoronaVac vaccination. However, the beneficial and protective effects of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of this generally self-limiting adverse event. Additional studies are needed in other regions to confirm our findings.",p63i69,p63i69,Bifobe,1,covid19

The natural occurence of Bell's Palsy ranges from 11-40 per 100 000 annually, so its not always easy to determine if there is an increased risk, especially since the causes of Bells Palsy is unknown.

By the morning of 12/13/21, I noticed that I had reduced sensitivity on my tongue and thought maybe I had burned it while drinking hot coffee. By 12/14,  I noticed that my right eye felt very stiff like I had a stye. Later when I was brushing my teeth in the mirror I suddenly felt like I was having a stroke--blurry vision, lightheadedness and I saw the right side of my face go numb. Rushed to the ER and was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy for the first time in my life.

The symptoms worsened and peaked around 12/16, impacting my: talking, smiling, laughing, eating, drinking, taste, hearing, driving, involuntary blinking, overall eyesight and sleeping (I think that covers most of it). Not to mention I experienced severe pain and extreme sensitivity to touch on the right side of my face for \~3 weeks. It's no longer sore but painful to sleep on my right side with my face fully bearing the weight on my pillow.

As of 1/21/22, I would estimate that I am 35-40% recovered. Taste is back, hearing has improved (still some pain, sensitivity and ringing), right eye feels less tight, smile is improving and eating/drinking is nowhere near as difficult.

In June 2020, HWs in the Johns Hopkins Health System provided oral informed consent to participate in a longitudinal study of S1 spike antibodies in which serum samples and survey responses were collected every 3 to 4 months. Ethical approval was obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. The HWs who participated for a study visit between March 10 and April 8, 2021, were included in this analysis if their serum sample was collected 14 or more days after receiving dose 2 of either mRNA vaccine. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun), IgG antibody measurements were determined based on optical density ratios with an upper threshold of 11 based on assay saturation.1 Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as having (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result prior to 14 days after dose 2 or (2) S1 spike IgG measurement greater than 1.23 prior to vaccination.5 Participants self-reported symptoms following vaccination as none, mild (injection site pain, mild fatigue, headache), or clinically significant (fatigue, fever, chills). Logistic regression models were used to explore the association of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine type with symptoms following each dose, adjusting for sex and age. A linear regression model was used to explore the association between magnitude of antibody response (log-transformed) and age, sex, prior infection, vaccine type, symptoms, and time after 2 doses of vaccine. Analyses were performed in R, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation).

Results

A questionnaire and serum sample were collected 14 or more days following dose 2 for 954 HWs. Clinically significant symptoms were reported by 52 of the 954 (5%) after dose 1 and 407 (43%) after dose 2. After adjusting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, and sex, the odds of clinically significant symptoms following either dose were higher among participants who received the Moderna vs the Pfizer vaccine (dose 1: odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 0.96-3.50; dose 2: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.73-3.40) (Table). Prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure was associated with increased odds of clinically significant symptoms following dose 1 (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.25-8.55) but not dose 2 (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-0.99), after controlling for vaccine type, age, and sex.

**Regardless of symptoms, the vast majority of participants (953 of 954, greater than 99.9%) developed spike IgG antibodies 14 or more days following dose 2; 1 participant who was taking immunosuppressant medication did not develop IgG antibodies (Figure)**. Reporting clinically significant symptoms, age younger than 60 years, female sex, receipt of Moderna vaccine, and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure were independently associated with higher median IgG measurements, after adjusting for time after dose 2",p61ahc,p61ahc,icloudbug,1,covid19

h9a0n1i,1629200389.0,Flarewing123,"To the point about early vaccine recipients in Jan not matching the antibody curve provided, that NEJM link does not account for Delta data. It is from this paper on Moderna's vaccine, which you can see was published first in April.

Here is what I have gathered about antibody levels and protection based on my review of the evidence, to no one in particular. Based on the ""best"" antibody data we have that I am aware of, which are generally Pfizer and Moderna's press releases of their ongoing clinical trial results, antibodies start out much lower against variants like Beta and Delta and reduce from there. But also note that a 3rd dose booster produces a much higher antibody level against the variants than even the original 2-dose regime did against the original disease manifestation.

(Slides 25 - 27)

(By ""best"" data, I mean ""the most representative dataset"". This is not necessarily the same as the most peer-reviewed and fully published COVID dataset available, which is what defines ""best"" to many others. But I think it is a mistake to over-privilege the most peer-reviewed datasets when their underlying data don't represent the Delta timeframe, or when the most peer-reviewed study that reports high efficacy against Delta was studied only on a relatively recently vaccinated population. This is the fault of many hot takes going around on the different efficacy data reported in different areas).

Moderna's antibody data tells a similar story: smaller protection to start with against the variants that wanes from there (Moderna does have a higher antibody starting point that delays waning some though), and 3rd dose boosters skyrocket those low antibody levels up to much higher than they ever were. Here's actual papers on that.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256716v1.full-text

Now that we know generally where the antibody count is at for a certain timepoint for a certain variant, it is useful to compare to the best data I know of on ""how high of an antibody level do you need to produce a certain percentage of protection against symptomatic illness"". (Using only antibodies to predict protection in absence of T-cell or B-cell data provokes groans from some, since typically they contribute to protection too. But as it turns out for COVID-19 symptomatic illness, by far the largest predictive role goes purely to the antibody level. This is why papers like this one could track and even predict other vaccine's efficacy against symptomatic illness just by assessing the antibody levels alone).

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.09.21252641v1.full.pdf

So finally, this paper shows how your level of antibodies relates to protection against symptomatic illness as antibody levels wane over time.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.09.21261290v1.full.pdf

I would not take the exact numbers as prescriptive, just the order of magnitudes and the general shape of the curve. But you can compare that graph to the press release antibody titer graph from the two companies. That lets you get an idea of how effective the waning antibody levels are vs the boosted levels (being careful not to confuse pseudovirus titers and live virus titers...generally different assays make it hard to compare different antibody papers directly, which is why that paper above normalized to the fraction of convalescent sera's protection).

So anyway, when I take all that antibody data and compare it to the various efficacy data coming out from Israel, it becomes clear to me that waning is most likely a real thing that is happening. In absence of looking at the antibody data like this, I see how others come to different conclusions from just looking at efficacy data--Nate Silver outlined the challenges that can make those datasets noisy and imperfectly predictive here...

imgur.com/a/rMYCx8V

...but with antibody data included, the most parsimonious story involves antibody waning to some degree. Even the higher starting protection from Moderna will drop off a cliff the same as Pfizer, maybe not too long afterward based on that curve above. 

So I wish we would pivot quicker to telling folks that, yes waning will happen in 6-8 months, which will impact much if not most of your protection against symptomatic illness from COVID-19. But you can get a 3rd dose booster to completely fix that issue if you choose to avoid sickness and any risk of Long Covid. And even if you don't want a 3rd dose, your severe disease protection will stay pretty solid with just 2 doses.",p5skc3,h98g0pm,thaw4188,2,covid19

The immune response in response to natural infection is certainly different to the response to vaccination (for one thing, the former has a pretty significant chance of hospitalising or killing you). From the other side of things, the vaccines present very tightly controlled proteins (generally the most strongly conserved ones), whereas natural infection presents the whole gammut, so the body produces an immune response to those specific proteins in the former case, and to a largely-random scattering of proteins from across the virus in the latter.

Surely the virus will spread most quickly through people who only developed weak immunity, many of whom will then develop a considerably stronger immunity when they become convalescent?

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced that they have submitted Phase 1 data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support the evaluation of a third, or booster, dose of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) for future licensure. These data also will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks.

>“Vaccination is our most effective means of preventing COVID-19 infection – especially severe disease and hospitalization – and its profound impact on protecting lives is indisputable. Still, with the continuing threat of the Delta variant and possible emergence of other variants in the future, we must remain vigilant against this highly contagious virus,” said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. “The data we’ve seen to date suggest a third dose of our vaccine elicits antibody levels that significantly exceed those seen after the two-dose primary schedule. We are pleased to submit these data to the FDA as we continue working together to address the evolving challenges of this pandemic.”

>“We continuously strive to stay at least one step ahead of the virus. This is why we aim to expand access to our vaccine for people around the world and are working on various approaches as part of our comprehensive strategy to address the virus and its variants today as well as in the future,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. “This initial data indicate that we may preserve and even exceed the high levels of protection against the wild-type virus and relevant variants using a third dose of our vaccine. A booster vaccine could help reduce infection and disease rates in people who have previously been vaccinated and better control the spread of virus variants during the coming season.”

>Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted Phase 1 data – part of their Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial program – evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in U.S. adult participants from the Phase 1 trial of the two-dose series. Participants received a 30-µg booster dose of BNT162b2 8 to 9 months after receiving the second dose. Results from this participant group show that the third dose elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibodies against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type) compared to the levels observed after the two-dose primary series, as well as against the Beta variant and the highly infectious Delta variant.

>Phase 3 results evaluating the third dose are expected shortly and will be submitted to the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities worldwide. In the U.S., Pfizer and BioNTech plan to seek licensure of the third dose via a supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA) in individuals 16 years of age and older, pending FDA approval of the primary BLA submitted in May 2021.",p5l4kn,p5l4kn,RufusSG,1,covid19

>CureVac N.V. (Nasdaq: CVAC), a global biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), and GSK today announced the publication of preclinical data investigating immune responses as well as the protective efficacy of CureVac’s first-generation vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, and second-generation vaccine candidate, CV2CoV, against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in non-human primates. The study assessed cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with 12µg of either the first or second-generation vaccine candidate. Better activation of innate and adaptive immune responses was achieved with CV2CoV, resulting in faster response onset, higher titers of antibodies, and stronger memory B and T cell activation as compared to the first-generation candidate, CVnCoV. Higher antibody neutralizing capacity was observed with CV2CoV across all selected variants, including the Beta, Delta and Lambda variants. During challenge with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, animals vaccinated with CV2CoV were found to be better protected based on highly effective clearance of the virus in the lungs and nasal passages. The full manuscript of the preclinical data is available on the pre-print server bioRxiv.

>“In this animal model, CV2CoV is shown to induce broad antibody and cellular immune responses very similar to the breadth of the immune responses observed after infection with SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr. Igor Splawski, Chief Scientific Officer of CureVac. “The current study shows that the immune responses and resulting protection produced by our second-generation candidate, based on our mRNA technology featuring targeted optimizations, are substantially improved in non-human primates against both, the original SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the Beta and Delta Variants of Concern and the Lambda Variant of Interest.”

>Dr. Rino Rappuoli, Chief Scientist and head of GSK Vaccines R&D said “The mRNA technology is a key strategic priority for us, and we are investing significantly in a number of mRNA programs focused on the collaboration with CureVac. The strong immune response and protection in pre-clinical testing of this second-generation mRNA backbone are very encouraging and represent an important milestone for its further development.”

>Within the study, CVnCoV and CV2CoV were tested in cynomolgus macaques immunized with a 12 µg dose of the respective candidate on day 0 and day 28. Induction of innate immunity was investigated via specific cytokine markers. Adaptive immune responses were assessed based on receptor binding domain specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies as well as memory B and T cells. Impact of Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest on neutralizing antibody titers was tested against the Alpha, Beta, Delta, Kappa and the Lambda variant. Clearance of the virus in the lungs and nasal passages of the animals was tested following challenge infection with the original virus.

>The CureVac-GSK COVID-19 collaboration announced in February 2021 extends the existing strategic mRNA technology partnership both companies started in July 2020, which focuses on the development of new products based on CureVac’s second-generation RNA-technology for different targets in the field of infectious diseases. The optimised mRNA backbone that is being used in this collaboration also has the potential for a multivalent or combination approach to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine. Following the current preclinical development of CV2CoV, a Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to start in Q4 2021.

>**About CV2CoV**

>CV2CoV is CureVac’s first candidate based on the advanced second-generation mRNA backbone currently developed in collaboration with GSK. The vaccine candidate, presently at a preclinical development stage, is a non-chemically modified mRNA, encoding the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and formulated within Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs). CV2CoV was engineered with specifically optimized non-coding regions to exhibit improved mRNA translation for increased and extended protein expression compared the first-generation mRNA backbone. Preclinical studies in different animal models demonstrate CV2CoV’s ability to induce earlier and stronger immune responses. The first clinical trial of CV2CoV is expected to start in Q4 2021.",p5jqv5,p5jqv5,RufusSG,1,covid19

Importance

  As a result of low numbers of pediatric cases early in the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains an understudied topic.  
  
Objective 

 To determine whether there are differences in the odds of household transmission by younger children compared with older children.  
  
Design, Setting, and Participants  

This population-based cohort study took place between June 1 and December 31, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Private households in which the index case individual of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was younger than 18 years were included. Individuals were excluded if they resided in apartments missing suite information, in households with multiple index cases, or in households where the age of the index case individual was missing.  
  
Exposures  

Age group of pediatric index cases categorized as 0 to 3, 4 to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 17 years.  
  
Main Outcomes and Measures  

Household transmission, defined as households where at least 1 secondary case occurred 1 to 14 days after the pediatric index case.  
  
Results  

A total of 6280 households had pediatric index cases, and 1717 households (27.3%) experienced secondary transmission. The mean (SD) age of pediatric index case individuals was 10.7 (5.1) years and 2863 (45.6%) were female individuals. **Children aged 0 to 3 years had the highest odds of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to household contacts compared with children aged 14 to 17 years (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.17-1.75).** This association was similarly observed in sensitivity analyses defining secondary cases as 2 to 14 days or 4 to 14 days after the index case and stratified analyses by presence of symptoms, association with a school/childcare outbreak, or school/childcare reopening. Children aged 4 to 8 years and 9 to 13 years also had increased odds of transmission (aged 4-8 years: odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67; aged 9-13 years: odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.32).  
  
Conclusions and Relevance  

This study suggests that younger children may be more likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with older children, and the highest odds of transmission was observed for children aged 0 to 3 years. Differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention within households, as well as schools/childcare, to minimize risk of household secondary transmission. Additional population-based studies are required to establish the risk of transmission by younger pediatric index cases.",p5ii3i,p5ii3i,icloudbug,1,covid19
h96jc3l,1629134710.0,rothbard_anarchist,"What doesn't get much discussion is the distribution of index cases:
 
>The proportion of index cases in each age group increased with age, with 12% (776 of 6280) aged 0 to 3 years, 20% (1257 of 6280) aged 4 to 8 years, 30% (1881 of 6280) aged 9 to 13 years, and 38% (2376 of 6280) aged 14 to 17 years.

If the group was a random sample, *and* age wasn't a factor in catching Covid, you'd expect the percentages to be 22%, 28%, 28%, 22%.  But they're skewed older, which goes against concluding from the higher secondary attack rate that young children as a whole are more or even as infective as older children.",p5ii3i,p5ii3i,icloudbug,1,covid19

The bubble plot is also pretty fascinating though it mostly just shows what ages the index cases' siblings and parents were!

I suspect there might be an effect where infants whose adaptive immune systems are more 'blank slates' versus older kids who have some 'primed' (but still more readily adaptable than adults') cross-immunity as in this study: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/738",p5ii3i,p5ii3i,icloudbug,1,covid19

Background: Our understanding of the association between coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and preterm or early term birth among racially and ethnically diverse populations and people with chronic medical conditions is limited.  
  
Methods: We determined the association between COVID-19 and preterm (PTB) birth among live births documented by California Vital Statistics birth certificates between July 2020 and January 2021 (n=240,147). We used best obstetric estimate of gestational age to classify births as very preterm (VPTB, <32 weeks), PTB (< 37 weeks), early term (37 and 38 weeks), and term (39-44 weeks), as each confer independent risks to infant health and development. Separately, we calculated the joint effects of COVID-19 diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity on PTB and VPTB.  
  
Findings: COVID-19 diagnoses on birth certificates increased for all racial/ethnic groups between July 2020 and January 2021 and were highest for American Indian/Alaska Native (12.9%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (11.4%), and Latinx (10.3%) birthing people. COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of VPTB (aRR 1.6, 95% CI \[1.4, 1.9\]), PTB (aRR 1.4, 95% CI \[1.3, 1.4\]), and early term birth (aRR 1.1, 95% CI \[1.1, 1.2\]). There was no effect modification of the overall association by race/ethnicity or insurance status. COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with elevated risk of PTB in people with hypertension, diabetes, and/or obesity.  
  
Interpretation: In a large population-based study, COVID-19 diagnosis increased the risk of VPTB, PTB, and early term birth, particularly among people with medical comorbidities. Considering increased circulation of COVID-19 variants, preventative measures, including vaccination, should be prioritized for birthing persons.",p5g9dc,p5g9dc,NewNote947,1,covid19

h9cn6ry,1629244164.0,Thin-Ad-9709,"I would like to attempt to break this article down and share some thoughts about it.

There's a lot going on in this article, not just in terms of the variety of experiments and analysis, but in terms of potential lessons learned that we might apply to SARS2.

_This study began before Delta was prominent, hence why it's not mentioned at all._


- The study used transgenic yeast with a part of the spike protein. No virus was actually used, and there was no literal virus evolution being studied.


- The study focused specifically on a portion of the spike protein. The rest of the viral particle was beyond the scope of the study. The portion in question is called the **RBD**. It is the ""main part"" of the spike protein that binds to ACE2.


- ""Evolution"" is a misnomer. A serial selection process was done by the researchers, mimicking evolution of a part of the spike protein in an ingenious and pretty comprehensive but still limited way.


- Variants of the RBD were generated artificially and randomly. The selection was based on the temperature stability and, more importantly, how efficient and strong the variant protein and ACE2 would bind together.


- An extremely interesting result of this experiment was not only did they identify some specific mutations that lead to better binding to ACE2, but it turns out some of these mutations had in fact already existed in some of the main SARS2 variants in the real world.


- They found a handful of other small changes (or combinations of changes) that resulted in better binding between the spike RBD and ACE2, not necessarily found prominently in real COVID samples (yet?)


- One of these spoke RBD variants blew them away pretty much. It was a combination of an existing mutation with another called Q498. They suggested we should be on the lookout for new COVID variants with this mutation combination.


- In the end, they had a bunch of different mutation combinations that were very efficient at binding to ACE2. Some of them were relatively complex, including several mutations at once.


- The best of the best mutation combinations was number 62. This particular spike protein RBD was then isolated.


- Used as a drug, it helped hamsters from getting sick, while allowing ACE2 to continue to work normally.

I'd like to mention that they did not predict any particular real world COVID variants in this study. Known COVID variants are identified by a combination of key mutations. At best, the mutations they predicted would lead to better spike protein binding may overlap with COVID variants that exist or might exist in the future.

I looked into the Q498 mutation. According to this article https://academic.oup.com/abt/article/4/3/149/6325569 this mutation has not been found in the real world in any significant amount.

Background

Effective treatment for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is under intensive research. Nigella sativa oil (NSO) is a herbal medicine with antiviral and immunomodulatory activities, and has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of NSO treatment in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

All adult patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recruited for an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT). They were randomly divided into control or treatment groups, with the latter receiving 500 mg NSO (MARNYS® Cuminmar) twice daily for 10 days. Symptoms were daily monitored via telecommunication. The primary outcome focused on the percentage of patients who recovered (symptom-free for 3 days) within 14-days. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04401202).

Results

A total of 173 patients were enrolled for RCT. The average age was 36(±11) years, and 53% of patients were males. The control and NSO groups included 87 and 86 patients respectively. The percentage of recovered patients in NSO group (54[62%]) was significantly higher than that in the control group (31[36%]; p = 0.001). The mean duration to recovery was also shorter for patients receiving NSO (10.7 ± 3.2 days) compared with the control group (12.3 ± 2.8 days); p = 0.001.

Conclusions

NSO supplementation was associated with faster recovery of symptoms than usual care alone for patients with mild COVID-19 infection. These potential therapeutic benefits require further exploration with placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies.",p5b056,p5b056,LeatherCombination3,1,covid19

Abstract

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. 
The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. 
High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. 
Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. 
The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. 
Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. 
Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. 
Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. 
Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.",p59d2i,p59d2i,MummersFart,1,covid19

h8yzyo9,1628985626.0,psychiatrixx,"Highlights
* T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, MMR and Tdap vaccine proteins are highly correlated.
* SARS-CoV-2, MMR and Tdap antigen-experienced T cells share identical TCRs.
* T cells with shared TCRs have features of TEMRA, a memory anti-viral T cell subset.
* Prior MMR or Tdap vaccination correlates with reduced COVID-19 disease severity.

SUMMARY

BACKGROUND
T cells control viral infection and promote vaccine durability and in COVID-19 associate with mild disease. We investigated whether prior Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) or Tetanus-Diptheria-Pertussis (Tdap) vaccination elicit cross-reactive T cells that mitigate COVID-19.

METHODS
Antigen presenting cells (APC) loaded ex vivo with SARS-CoV-2, MMR or Tdap antigens and autologous T cells from COVID-19 convalescent and uninfected individuals, and COVID-19 mRNA vaccinated donors were co-cultured and T cell activation and phenotype were detected by IFN-γ ELISpot assays and flow cytometry. ELISA assays and validation studies identified the APC-derived cytokine(s) driving T cell activation. TCR clonotyping and scRNA-seq identified cross-reactive T cells and their transcriptional profile. A propensity-weighted analysis of COVID-19 patients estimated the effects of MMR and Tdap vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes.

FINDINGS
High correlation was observed between T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Spike-S1 and Nucleocapsid) and MMR and Tdap proteins in COVID-19 convalescent and vaccinated individuals. The overlapping T cell population contained an effector memory T cell subset (TEMRA) implicated in protective, anti-viral immunity and their detection required APC-derived IL-15, known to sensitize T cells to activation. Cross-reactive TCR repertoires detected in antigen-experienced T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2, MMR and Tdap epitopes had TEMRA features. Indices of disease severity were reduced in MMR or Tdap vaccinated individuals by 32-38% and 20-23% respectively, among COVID-19 patients.

CONCLUSIONS
Tdap and MMR memory T cells reactivated by SARS-CoV-2 may provide protection against severe COVID-19 disease.",p4erz1,p4erz1,icloudbug,1,covid19

Objective

To analyse the correlation between COVID-19 vaccination percentage and socioeconomic status (SES).

Methods

A nationwide ecologic study based on open-sourced, anonymized, aggregated data provided by the Israel Ministry of Health. The correlations between municipal SES, vaccination percentage and active COVID-19 cases during the vaccination campaign were analysed by using weighted Pearson correlations. To assess the adequacy of first dose vaccination rollout relative to the municipality COVID-19 disease burden, a metric termed the vaccination need ratio was devised by dividing the total number of active cases (per 10 000 people) by the vaccination percentage of the population over 60 in each municipality, and its correlation with the SES was examined.

Results

23 days after initiation of the vaccination campaign, 760 916 (56.8%) individuals over the age of 60 were vaccinated in Israel with the first dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. A negative correlation was found between the COVID-19 active case burden and the vaccination percentage of the study population in each municipality (r = –0.47, 95% CI –0.59 to –0.30). The vaccination percentage significantly correlated with the municipal SES (r = 0.83, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.87). This finding persisted but was attenuated over a 5-week period. A negative correlation between the vaccination need ratio and municipal SES (r = –0.80, 95% CI –0.88 to –0.66) was found.

Discussion

Lower COVID-19 vaccination percentage was associated with lower SES and high active disease burden. Vaccination efforts should focus on areas with lower SES and high disease burden to assure equality of vaccine allocation and potentially provide a more diligent disease mitigation.",p42r2f,p42r2f,alyahudi,1,covid19

Moreover, we find that males and children in lower socioeconomic families have been most affected. Results highlight that even in the absence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness, the environmental changes associated COVID-19 pandemic is significantly and negatively affecting infant and child development.",p3wlrd,p3wlrd,H2PoonSlayer,1,covid19

h8t51j3,1628876983.0,BillyGrier,"**Background:**  
Millions have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but the severity of resultant infections has varied among adults and children, with adults presenting more serious symptomatic cases. Children may possess an immunity that adults lack, possibly from childhood vaccinations. This retrospective study suggests immunization against the poliovirus may provide an immunity to SARS-CoV-2.  
  
**Methods:**  
Publicly available data were analyzed for possible correlations between national median ages and epidemiological outbreak patterns across 100 countries. Sera from 204 adults and children, who were immunized with the poliovirus vaccine, were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of polio-immune serum on SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathology in cell culture were then evaluated.  
  
**Results:**  
Analyses of median population age demonstrated a positive correlation between median age and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and death rates. Countries with effective poliovirus immunization protocols and younger populations have fewer and less pathogenic cases of COVID-19. Antibodies to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were found in pediatric sera and in sera from adults recently immunized with polio. Sera from polio-immunized individuals inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cell cultures. These results suggest the anti-D3-pol-antibody, induced by poliovirus vaccination, may provide a similar degree of protection from SARS-CoV-2 to adults as to children.  
  
**Conclusions:**  
Poliovirus vaccination induces an adaptive humoral immune response. Antibodies created by poliovirus vaccination bind the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of both poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings suggest proteins other than “spike” proteins may be suitable targets for immunity and vaccine development.",p3pi91,p3pi91,CheetahridingMongoos,1,covid19
h8t5dhu,1628877115.0,BillyGrier,"**From Discussion**  
____
Second, we propose that these results help explain why there is an apparent age-dependent outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection (1–3). There are many exceptions to this observation, as disease is seen in these younger age groups, but at a much lower incidence than the life-threatening disease often seen in adults (24, 25). While younger individuals may still possess immunity from childhood vaccinations, older adults can mount an adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 following poliovirus re-immunization. Without IPV or OPV boosters, older adults may remain at higher risk of severe disease and mortality (2, 26, 27). This retrospective study provides a preliminary understanding of the role poliovirus vaccination has in inhibiting viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. We are currently conducting a larger clinical trial (NCT04639375) to provide deeper validation of the potential utility of the safe and effective poliovirus vaccine as a prophylactic measure against COVID-19 infection (28).  
___
The poliovirus vaccine poses minimal risk. The World Health Organization recommends poliovirus vaccine boosters for adults traveling to high-risk zones of polio infection (31). In comparison to other vaccines that are currently being tested for COVID-19 prevention, poliovirus vaccines, both IPV and OPV, are readily available with prior pharmacological, toxicity, chemical, manufacturing, and control data. Possible risks have been studied for over 60 years and all processes have been well-documented and established. Given the current climate of vaccine hesitancy with the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out, and projected vaccine shortage across the globe, the results reported here suggest more attention should be given to a vaccine that 90% of the world's population received as children. While these data show proteins other than “spike” proteins, such as RdRp, may be suitable targets for immunity and vaccine development, IPV may also be used to complement the new Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) COVID-19 vaccines, to further boost immunity and enhance the population's health. The results described here could be strengthened by additional studies performed in multiple countries—including low-income countries—to explore any possible variation in CPE of sera, especially among countries that administer OPV, compared to those that utilize IPV for childhood vaccinations.",p3pi91,h8t51j3,BillyGrier,2,covid19

h8stohj,1628872506.0,MummersFart,"“Thacker’s comprehensive review of the Wuhan laboratory leak hypothesis makes for uncomfortable reading.1 That a small group of scientists, with (apparently) hitherto undeclared links to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, were able to prevent open minded, critical analysis of the origins of SARS-CoV-2 for much of 2020 is regrettable.

Their actions to shut down debate about a possible laboratory incident as a source of SARS-CoV-2 escaping into Wuhan city have seriously damaged the chances that we will ever find out the truth of what transpired in 2019. We draw two key lessons from Thacker’s review.

Firstly, all scientific and medical journals should reflect on their declaration of interest policies for authors. They should carefully examine them to see if there are any loopholes that might allow authors to be less than fully transparent. They should not restrict the search for conflicts of interest to the purely financial. Journals might consider withdrawing articles if substantial undeclared associations or financial or other interests come to light after publication. This might encourage those who would choose opacity to think twice.

Secondly, the prevailing “consensus” in 2020 that covid-19 must have arisen from SARS-CoV-2 jumping the species barrier from, for example, an unknown Chinese bat to a human host to the exclusion of all other possibilities has lessons for us all. One recalls a medical grand round at a London teaching hospital years ago, the theme of which was “Always challenge orthodoxy.” From time to time, or perhaps more often, it’s important for us all to think hard and critically about what we know, or in the case of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, what we think we know.”",p3oqep,p3oqep,MummersFart,1,covid19

> A number of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have been identified that partially escape serum neutralisation activity elicited by current vaccines. Recent studies have also shown that vaccines demonstrate reduced protection against symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we integrate published data on in vitro neutralisation and clinical protection to understand and predict vaccine efficacy against existing SARS-CoV-2 variants. We find that neutralising activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is highly predictive of neutralisation of the VOC, with all vaccines showing a similar drop in neutralisation to the variants. Neutralisation levels remain strongly correlated with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 VOC (r=0.81, p=0.0005). We apply an existing model relating in vitro neutralisation to protection (parameterised on data from ancestral virus infection) and find this remains predictive of vaccine efficacy against VOC once drops in neutralisation to the VOC are taken into account. Modelling of predicted vaccine efficacy against variants over time suggests that protection against symptomatic infection may drop below 50% within the first year after vaccination for some current vaccines. Boosting of previously infected individuals with existing vaccines (which target ancestral virus) has been shown to significantly increase neutralising antibodies. Our modelling suggests that booster vaccination should enable high levels of immunity that prevent severe infection outcomes with the current SARS-CoV-2 VOC, at least in the medium term.",p3ofoo,p3ofoo,enterpriseF-love,1,covid19

Are there any findings with regards to to the level of neutralisation required to protect against severe symptoms? Based on the title of the article, I thought it was going to be about that.

> **Methods:** A prospective cohort of 332 COVID-19 patients was followed beyond one year. Plasma neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV-based reporter pseudoviruses expressing different SARS-CoV-2 spikes and was longitudinally analyzed using mixed-effects models. 

> **Findings:** Long-term neutralizing activity was stable beyond one year after infection in mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized participants. However, longitudinal models suggest that hospitalized individuals generate both short- and long-lived memory B cells, while outpatient responses were dominated by long-lived B cells. In both groups, vaccination boosted responses to natural infection, although viral variants, mainly B.1.351, reduced the efficacy of neutralization. Importantly, despite showing higher neutralization titers, hospitalized patients showed lower cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variant compared to outpatients. Multivariate analysis identified severity of primary infection as the factor that independently determines both the magnitude and the inferior cross-neutralization activity of long-term neutralizing responses. Conclusions: Neutralizing response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous in magnitude but stable beyond one year after infection. Vaccination boosts these long-lasting natural neutralizing responses, counteracting the significant resistance to neutralization of new viral variants.

Testing Denmark is a national large-scale epidemiological surveillance study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Danish population. Methods Between September and October 2020, approximately 1.3 million of 5.8 million Danish citizens (age > 15 years) were randomly invited to fill in an electronic questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposures and symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined by Point-of Care rapid Test (POCT) distributed to participants home addresses. Findings In total 318,552 participants (24.5% invitees) completed the questionnaire and provided the result of the POCT. Of these, 2,519 (0.79%) were seropositive (median age 55 years) and women were more often seropositive than men, interquartile range (IQR) 42-64, 40.2% males. Of participants with a prior positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test (n=1,828), 29.1% were seropositive in the POCT. Seropositivity increased with age irrespective of sex. Elderly participants (>61 years) reported less symptoms and had less frequently been tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger participants. Seropositivity was associated with physical contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Risk ratio (RR) 7.43, 95% CI: 6.57-8.41) and in particular household members (RR 17.70, 95% CI: 15.60-20.10). Home care workers had a higher risk of seropositivity (RR 2.09 (95% CI: 1.58-2.78) as compared to office workers. Geographic population density was not associated to seropositivity. A high degree of compliance with national preventive recommendations was reported (e.g., > 80% use of face masks), but no difference was found between seropositive and seronegative participants. Interpretation This study provides insight into the immunity of the Danish population seven to eight months after the first COVID-19 case in Denmark. The seroprevalence was lower than expected probably due to a low sensitivity of the POCT used or due to challenges relating to the reading of test results. Occupation or exposure in local communities were major routes of infection. As elderly participants were more often seropositive despite fewer symptoms and less PCR tests performed, more emphasis should be placed on testing this age group.",p3o011,p3o011,icloudbug,1,covid19

> Background: SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology implicates airborne transmission; mask source-control efficacy for, variant impact on, and infectiousness of aerosols are not well understood. Methods: We recruited COVID-19 cases to give blood, saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs, and 30-minute breath samples while vocalizing into a Gesundheit-II, with and without masks at up to two visits two days apart. We quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus, and assayed sera for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies. Results: We enrolled 61 participants with active infection, May 2020 through April 2021. Among 49 seronegative cases (mean days post onset 3.8 ±2.1), we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 45% of fine (≥5 μm), 31% of coarse (>5 μm) aerosols, and 65% of fomite samples overall and in all samples from four alpha variant cases. Masks reduced viral RNA by 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 72%) in fine and by 77% (95% CI, 51 to 89%) in coarse aerosols. The alpha variant was associated with a 43-fold (95% CI, 6.6 to 280-fold) increase in fine aerosol viral RNA that remained a significant 18-fold (95% CI, 3.4 to 92-fold) increase adjusting for viral RNA in saliva, in mid-turbinate swabs, and other potential confounders. Two fine aerosol samples, collected days 2-3 post illness onset, while participants wore masks, were culture-positive.

Objective To understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

Methods: January 6 through May 31, 2021, 5,121,436 US adults completed an online COVID-19 survey. Weighted data was used to evaluate change in vaccine intent and correlates of May vaccine hesitancy.

Results: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased by one-third from January to May, with relatively large decreases among participants with Black, Pacific Islander or Hispanic race/ethnicity and ≤high school education. In May, independent hesitancy risk factors included younger age, non-Asian race, having a PhD or ≤high school education, living in a rural county, living in a county with higher 2020 Trump support, lack of worry about COVID-19, working outside the home, never intentionally avoiding contact with others, and no past-year flu vaccine. Differences in hesitancy by race/ethnicity varied by age. Almost half of vaccine hesitant respondents reported fear of side effects and not trusting the COVID-19 vaccine; over one-third reported not trusting the government, not needing the vaccine, and waiting to see if safe. Reasons differed by degree of vaccine intent and by race/ethnicity.

Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy varied by demographics, geography, beliefs, and behaviors.",p3lk83,p3lk83,StereoPr,1,covid19

Speaking of, how else do you think we should gather these populations? Outside of measurable organ damage, we do not have reliably specific biomarkers.

We know that with Ancestral strains, non vaccinated people who caught it, were shedding virus starting 24-36 hours after being infected - even though symptoms didn't show up until roughly 5 days after you were infected.

 **The median time of infectious virus shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms** and **probit analysis showed a probability of ≤5% for isolating infectious SARS-CoV-2 when the duration of symptoms was 15.2 days or more** 

So that means with infections of covid, prior to Delta, your average covid patient was shedding virus for 8 days AFTER symptoms and most likely 4 days before showing symptoms - so shedding virus for an average of 12 days.

Background 
The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit India from early April 2021 to June 2021 and more than 400,000 cases per day were reported in the country. We describe the clinical features, demography, treatment trends, baseline laboratory parameters of a cohort of patients admitted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their association with the outcome. 

Methods 
This was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical, laboratory and treatment patterns of consecutive patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the clinical and biochemical predictors of developing hypoxia, deterioration during the hospital stay and death. 

Findings 
A total of 2080 patients were included in the study. The case fatality rate was 19.5%. Amongst the survivors, the median duration of hospital stay was 8 (5-11) days. Out of 853 (42.3%%) of patients who had COVID-19 Acute respiratory distress syndrome at presentation, 340 (39.9%) died. Patients aged 45-60 years [OR (95% CI): 1.8 (1.2-2.6)p =0.003] and those aged >60 years [OR (95%CI): 3.4 (2.3-5.2), p<0.001] had a higher odds of death as compared to the 18-44 age group. Vaccination reduced the odds of death by 30% [OR (95% CI): 0.7 (0.5-0.9), p=0.036]. Patients with hyper inflammation at baseline as suggested by leucocytosis [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.4-3.10), p <0.001], raised d-dimer >500 mg/dL [OR (95% CI): 3.2 (2.2-4.6), p <0.001] and raised C-reactive peptide >0.5 mg/L [OR (95% CI): 3.8 (1.1-13), p=0.037] had higher odds of death. Patients who were admitted in the second week had lower odds of death and those admitted in the third week had higher odds of death. 

Interpretation 
This is the largest cohort of patients admitted with COVID-19 from India reported to date and has shown that vaccination status and early admission during the inflammatory phase can change the course of illness of these patients. Strategies should be made to improve vaccination rates and early admission of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to improve outcomes.",p3b6kt,p3b6kt,icloudbug,1,covid19

>Endothelial cells (ECs) play a crucial role in the development and propagation of the severe COVID-19 stage as well as multiorgan dysfunction. It remains, however, controversial whether COVID-19-induced endothelial injury is caused directly by the infection of ECs with SARS-CoV-2 or via indirect mechanisms. One of the major concerns is raised by the contradictory data supporting or denying the presence of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor, on the EC surface. Here, we show that primary human pulmonary artery ECs possess ACE2 capable of interaction with the viral Spike protein (S-protein) and demonstrate the crucial role of the endothelial glycocalyx in the regulation of the S-protein binding to ACE2 on ECs. Using force spectroscopy method, we directly measured ACE2- and glycocalyx-dependent adhesive forces between S-protein and ECs and characterized the nanomechanical parameters of the cells exposed to S-protein. We revealed that the intact glycocalyx strongly binds S-protein but screens its interaction with ACE2. Reduction of glycocalyx layer exposes ACE2 receptors and promotes their interaction with S-protein. These results indicate that the susceptibility of ECs to COVID-19 infection may depend on the glycocalyx condition.",p3akjb,p3akjb,tozalo,1,covid19

Reciprocal ID50 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMT) against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and the β variant, were 4700 and 765, respectively, at week 6, the peak of primary response, and 644 and 553, respectively, at a 5-month post-vaccination memory time point. Two weeks following homologous or heterologous boost β-specific reciprocal ID50 GMT were 5000 and 3000, respectively. At week 38, animals were challenged in the upper and lower airway with the β variant. Two days post-challenge, viral replication was low to undetectable in both BAL and nasal swabs in most of the boosted animals.

>**Background**

>There is continuing public concern about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. While there is no compelling biological reason to expect that mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (either preconception or during pregnancy) presents a risk to pregnancy, data are limited. It is, however, well documented that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with severe illness and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among recognized pregnancies in high-income countries, 11–16% end in spontaneous abortion (SAB).

>**Methods**

>People enrolled in v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based surveillance system, who received a COVID-19 vaccine preconception or during pregnancy were contacted by telephone to enroll in the v-safe pregnancy registry. V-safe pregnancy registry participants who received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or prior to 20 weeks’ gestation and who did not report a pregnancy loss before 6 completed weeks’ gestation were included in this analysis to assess the cumulative risk of SAB using Life Table methods.

>**Results**

>Among 2,456 pregnant persons who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, the cumulative risk of SAB from 6–19 weeks’ gestation was 14.1% (95% CI: 12.1, 16.1%). Using direct age standardization to the selected reference population, the age-standardized cumulative risk of SAB was 12.8% (95% CI: 10.8–14.8%).

>**Conclusions**

>When compared to the expected range of SABs in recognized pregnancies, these data suggest receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of SAB.

>Aims:

>To test whether plasma autoantibodies targeting the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor increase in COVID-19 infection; and to characterize the pharmacologic specificity, and signaling pathway activation occurring downstream of receptor binding in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells and cell toxicity of the autoantibodies.

>Methods:

>Plasma obtained from nineteen, older COVID-19 patients having mild or severe infection was subjected to protein-A affinity chromatography to obtain immunoglobulin G fraction. One-fortieth dilution of the protein-A eluate was tested for binding to a linear synthetic peptide QN.18 corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor. Mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were incubated with COVID-19 IgG autoantibodies in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors of G-protein coupled receptors, signaling pathway antagonists, or a novel decoy receptor peptide.

>Results:

>5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor autoantibody binding occurred in 17 of 19 (89%) patients with acute COVID-19 infection and increased level was significantly correlated with increased severity of COVID-19 infection. The agonist autoantibodies mediated acute neurite retraction in mouse neuroblastoma cells by a mechanism involving Gq11/PLC/IP3R/Ca2+ activation and RhoA/Rho kinase pathway signaling occurring downstream of receptor binding which had pharmacologic specificity consistent with binding to the 5-HT2A receptor. A novel synthetic peptide 5-HT2AR fragment, SN..8, dose-dependently blocked autoantibody-induced neurotoxicity. The COVID-19 autoantibodies displayed acute toxicity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (stress fiber formation, contraction) and modulated proliferation in a manner consistent with known ‘biased agonism’ on the 5-HT2A receptor.

>Conclusion:

>These data suggest that 5-HT2AR targeting autoantibodies are highly prevalent may contribute to pathophysiology in acute, severe COVID-19 infection.",p378ei,p378ei,tozalo,1,covid19

The trial was ran in Minas Gerais, Brazil, which according to quick googling is one of those areas in Brazil with large amounts of off  label drugs usage, including ivermectin.

It's impossible to say what impact this has. It is potentially small, but also potentially large. As an example the IVERCOR study, Argentina, was ran in an area where ivermectin usage was rampant. It had 55 percent of assessed patients excluded due to self reported ivermectin usage in past 5 days! *If* the usage is on similar levels in the Minas Gerais area then obviously this would have an impact on the quality of the results.

However, that slide doesn't match the randomization criteria from their [protocol paper](https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/5-117) at all.  For example, there were 6 weeks where nobody was randomized into the lopinavir-ritonavir treatment group.  There were 2 weeks where nobody was randomized into ivermectin.

The protocol paper states:

>Randomization and allocation  
>  
>Participants are randomly assigned with equal allocation using a pre-generated randomization list based on block sizes of 8. The block sizes may be increased or decreased depending on the number of active treatment arms. Allocation of participants to treatment arms is uniform across all concurrent interventions as well as placebo.

The researchers claimed that their first trial had 1:1:1 randomization.  (Search [their HCQ lopinavir-ritonavir paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2779044) for ""1:1:1"".)  Figure 1 in that paper doesn't show a 1:1:1 randomization.

* 244 allocated to lopinavir-ritonavir
* 227 allocated to control group

Another mid-trial change was allowing healthy people into the trial- anybody with a mild fever over 38C became eligible to be in the trial.

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T cells were detected at 12-months post-infection. Severity of acute illness was associated with higher frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies at 12-months.

I certainly have not come to that conclusion based on study data I've seen.

The Kentucky study posted above defined reinfection based on a positive test.  They were reviewing data in available databases.  They were not looking for symptomatic infection.

Do you really expect people whose immune system was only exposed to the spike protein based on an early variant to out perform people whose immune system was exposed to the entire virus?

From a recent UK paper

*""44% of infections occurred in fully vaccinated individuals, reflecting imperfect vaccine effectiveness against infection despite high overall levels of vaccination. Using self-reported vaccination status, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection in round 13 of 49% (22%, 67%) among participants aged 18 to 64 years, which rose to 58% (33%, 73%) when considering only strong positives (Cycle threshold \[Ct\] values < 27); also, we estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of 59% (23%, 78%),""*

This is the list of limitations from the Kentucky study

*"" First, reinfection was not confirmed through whole genome sequencing, which would be necessary to definitively prove that the reinfection was caused from a distinct virus relative to the first infection. Although in some cases the repeat positive test could be indicative of prolonged viral shedding or failure to clear the initial viral infection (9), given the time between initial and subsequent positive molecular tests among participants in this study, reinfection is the most likely explanation. Second, persons who have been vaccinated are possibly less likely to get tested. Therefore, the association of reinfection and lack of vaccination might be overestimated. Third, vaccine doses administered at federal or out-of-state sites are not typically entered in KYIR, so vaccination data are possibly missing for some persons in these analyses. In addition, inconsistencies in name and date of birth between KYIR and NEDSS might limit ability to match the two databases. Because case investigations include questions regarding vaccination, and KYIR might be updated during the case investigation process, vaccination data might be more likely to be missing for controls. Thus, the OR might be even more favorable for vaccination. Fourth, although case-patients and controls were matched based on age, sex, and date of initial infection, other unknown confounders might be present. Finally, this is a retrospective study design using data from a single state during a 2-month period; therefore, these findings cannot be used to infer causation. Additional prospective studies with larger populations are warranted to support these findings.""*

TheLastSamauri if you are as healthy as workers in healthcare systems I bet your risk of reinfection is closer to what was reported in the UK and Cleveland studies.  

However those studies were prior to the Delta variant.   Delta's proteins are still largely similar to earlier variants.

h8nrcz5,1628779249.0,Reddie_Mercury,"**Abstract**  
Background and aims: TLR4 is an important innate immune receptor that recognizes   
bacterial LPS, viral proteins and other pathogen associated molecular   
patterns (PAMPs). It is expressed on tissue-resident and immune cells.   
We previously proposed a model whereby SARS-CoV-2 activation of TLR4 via  
 its spike glycoprotein S1 domain increases ACE2 expression, viral loads  
 and hyperinflammation with COVID-19 disease \[1\]. Here we test this   
hypothesis in vitro and demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 domain   
is a TLR4 agonist in rat and human cells and induces a pro-inflammatory   
M1 macrophage phenotype in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages.   
Methods: Adult rat cardiac tissue resident macrophage-derived fibrocytes  
 (rcTMFs) were treated with either bacterial LPS or recombinant   
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein. The expression of ACE2 and other   
inflammatory and fibrosis markers were assessed by immunoblotting.   
S1/TLR4 co-localisation/binding was assessed by immunocytochemistry and   
proximity ligation assays on rcTMFs and human HEK-293 HA-TLR4-expressing  
 cells. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M1 or M2 macrophages   
with LPS/IFN-γ, S1/IFN-γ or IL-4 and RNA was extracted for RT-qPCR of   
M1/M2 markers and ACE2. Results: TLR4 activation by spike S1 or LPS   
resulted in the upregulation of ACE2 in rcTMFs as shown by   
immunoblotting. Likewise, spike S1 caused TLR4-mediated induction of the  
 inflammatory/wound healing marker COX-2 and concomitant downregulation   
of the fibrosis markers CTGF and Col3a1, similar to LPS. The specific   
TLR4 TIR domain signalling inhibitor CLI-095 (Resatorvid), blocked the   
effects of spike S1 and LPS, confirming that spike S1 is a TLR4 agonist   
and viral PAMP (VAMP). ACE2 expression was also inhibited by the dynamin  
 inhibitor Dynasore, suggesting ACE2 expression is mediated by the   
alternative endosomal/β-interferon pathway. Confocal immunofluorescence   
microscopy confirmed 1:1 stoichiometric spike S1 co-localisation with   
TLR4 in rat and human cells. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays   
confirmed spike S1 and TLR4 binding in human and rat cells. Spike   
S1/IFN-γ treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages induced pro-inflammatory  
 M1 polarisation as shown by an increase in IL-1-β and IL-6 mRNA.   
Conclusions: These results confirm that TLR4 is activated by the   
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and therefore TLR4 may be a   
receptor/accessory factor for the virus. By binding to and activating   
TLR4, spike S1 caused upregulation of ACE2, which may facilitate viral   
entry into cells. In addition, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage   
polarisation via TLR4 activation, links TLR4 activation by spike S1 to   
inflammation. The clinical trial testing of CLI-095 (Resatorvid) and   
other TLR4 antagonists in severe COVID-19, to reduce both viral entry   
into cells and hyperinflammation, is warranted. Our findings likely   
represent an important development in COVID-19 pathophysiology and   
treatment, particularly regarding cardiac complications and the role of   
macrophages.",p2vto1,p2vto1,icloudbug,1,covid19

> Background COVID-19 pandemic mitigation requires evidence-based strategies. Because COVID-19 can spread via respired droplets, most US states mandated mask use in public settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask efficacy against respiratory viruses, and observational studies conflict on whether mask use predicts lower infection rates. We hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use were associated with lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States.

> Methods We calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance dates of neighboring states with mandates.

> Results Earlier mask mandates were not associated with lower total cases or lower maximum growth rates. Earlier mandates were weakly associated with lower minimum COVID-19 growth rates. Mask use predicted lower minimum but not lower maximum growth rates. Growth rates and total growth were comparable between US states in the first and last mask use quintiles during the Fall-Winter wave. These observations persisted for both natural logarithmic and fold growth models and when adjusting for differences in US state population density.

BACKGROUND

Vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) is a new syndrome associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data are lacking on the clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder.

METHODS

We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined.

RESULTS

Among 294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical risk factors. Overall mortality was 22%. The odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed mortality was 73% among patients with platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage.

CONCLUSIONS

The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment remains uncertain, but identification of prognostic markers may help guide effective management.

>Health Canada's review of the available information concluded that a link between the use of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine and COVISHIELD and the risk of these blood clots with low platelets is possible.

Someone might be able to correct me on this, but it would seem that with an intramuscularly delivered vaccine a limited handful of muscle cells would be impregnated and start producing spike protein.

Background

Some Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who have recovered from their acute infection after experiencing only mild symptoms continue to exhibit persistent exertional limitation that is often unexplained by conventional investigative studies.
Research question

What is the patho-physiological mechanism of exercise intolerance that underlies the post-COVID-19 long haul syndrome following COVID-19 in patients without cardio-pulmonary disease?
Study Design and Methods

This study examined the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, ventilation, and gas exchange in 10 post-COVID-19 patients without cardio-pulmonary disease during invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET) and compared the results to 10 age- and sex matched controls. These data were then used to define potential reasons for exertional limitation in the post-COVID-19 cohort.
Results

Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited markedly reduced peak exercise aerobic capacity (VO2) compared to controls (70±11%predicted vs. 131±45%predicted; p<0.0001). This reduction in peak VO2 was associated with impaired systemic oxygen extraction (i.e., narrow CaVO2/CaO2) compared to controls (0.49±0.1 vs. 0.78±0.1, p<0.0001) despite a preserved peak cardiac index (7.8±3.1 vs. 8.4±2.3 L/min, p>0.05). Additionally, post-COVID-19 patients demonstrated greater ventilatory inefficiency (i.e., abnormal VE/VCO2 slope: 35±5 vs. 27±5, p=0.01) compared to controls without an increase in dead space ventilation.
Interpretation

Post-COVID-19 patients without cardiopulmonary disease demonstrate a marked reduction in peak VO2 from a peripheral rather than a central cardiac limit along with an exaggerated hyper-ventilatory response during exercise.",p2l3el,p2l3el,icloudbug,1,covid19

It goes one of two ways. One is the way you describe. That requires a mutation that is both more infectious than delta (so it can become prevalent) and less deadly. It could very well happen. I like to call that the whimper.


The other way is the bang. In the bang, whatever comes after Delta ( ie a more infectious variant) avoids human immunity all together and kills 10% of its victims. At that point, humans do what they should have done on January 2020 and Sars-cov-2 goes the way of Sars 1.

From the end of June 2021, the state of Israel, where \~60\\% of the population is vaccinated with an mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, has an increase in the daily morbidity. This increase may be a result of different events: a temporal decline of the vaccine's efficacy; Lower efficacy of the vaccine against the current Delta ( (B.1.617.2) variant (which is now the dominant strain in Israel); A result of lack of social restrictions, a highly contagious variant, or any combination of the above. We found, by using a novel spatial-dynamic model and recent {aggregate} data from Israel, that this new surge of cases is partiality due to a decline in the shielding of those who were vaccinated about six months ago. Also, we found a decrease in the vaccine's efficacy against severe morbidity for the early elderly population compared to the rest of the vaccinated population. These results, which are consistent with recent studies, emphasize the high ability of the model in evaluating the time- and age-dependent efficacy of the vaccine for different age groups and enables to predict the spread of the pandemic as a function of such efficacy.",p2jkd9,p2jkd9,icloudbug,1,covid19

h8kfncn,1628708238.0,No_Entertainment_764,">A new analysis of the PRINCIPLE trial by Ly-Mee Yu and colleagues7 reported in The Lancet provides data from the largest trial of the use of inhaled corticosteroids in early-stage COVID-19. The primary outcome population included 833 participants who received inhaled budesonide plus usual care and 1126 who received usual care alone. The mean age was 64·2 years (SD 7·6), 1805 (92%) of 1959 participants were White, 1015 (52%) were women, and 1581 (81%) had comorbidities. The initial trial primary outcome was hospital admission or death, but this was changed before analysis because of lower than expected UK hospital admission rates (although the rate of hospital admissions or death in the trial was higher than the 5% estimated for the sample size calculation). Time to first self-reported recovery was added as a coprimary outcome. The results showed that using inhaled corticosteroids early in COVID-19 in patients aged 65 years and older and those aged 50 years and older with comorbidities shortened the time to first self-reported recovery by an estimated median of 2·94 days (95% Bayesian credible interval \[BCI\] 1·19–5·11), with an estimated time of 11·8 days (95% BCI 10·0–14·1) in the budesonide group versus 14·7 days (12·3–18·0) in the usual care group. The hospital admission or death outcome did not achieve the prespecified superiority threshold in the primary analysis population (72 \[9%\] of 787 in the budesonide group vs 116 (11%) of 1069 in the usual care group; model estimate 6·8% \[95% BCI 4·1–10·2\] vs 8·8% \[5·5–12·7\], odds ratio 0·75 \[95% BCI 0·55–1·03\]). The possibility of bias in the self-reported recovery outcome cannot be ruled out—placebos were not used and given that the primary and other secondary outcomes use self-report questions that are largely not based on instruments previously tested for reliability or validity, the well described placebo effect of inhalers could have inflated the effect size.

h8k22sc,1628702632.0,Zondax14,">Abstract  
Background: Data on breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infections are limited.  
  
Methods: We studied breakthrough infections among healthcare workers of a major infectious diseases hospital in Vietnam. We collected demographics, vaccination history and results of PCR diagnosis alongside clinical data. We measured SARS-CoV-2 (neutralizing) antibodies at diagnosis, and at week 1, 2 and 3 after diagnosis. We sequenced the viruses using ARTIC protocol.  
  
Findings: Between 11th–25th June 2021 (week 7–8 after dose 2), 69 healthcare workers were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 62 participated in the clinical study. 49 were (pre)symptomatic with one requiring oxygen supplementation. All recovered uneventfully. 23 complete-genome sequences were obtained. They all belonged to the Delta variant, and were phylogenetically distinct from the contemporary Delta variant sequences obtained from community transmission cases, suggestive of ongoing transmission between the workers. Viral loads of breakthrough Delta variant infection cases were 251 times higher than those of cases infected with old strains detected between March-April 2020. Time from diagnosis to PCR negative was 8–33 days (median: 21). Neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination and at diagnosis of the cases were lower than those in the matched uninfected controls. There was no correlation between vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody levels and viral loads or the development of symptoms.  
  
Interpretation: Breakthrough Delta variant infections are associated with high viral loads, prolonged PCR positivity, and low levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, explaining the transmission between the vaccinated people. Physical distancing measures remain critical to reduce SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant transmission.",p2erx6,p2erx6,icloudbug,1,covid19

Since the first reports of novel coronavirus in the 2020, public health organizations have advocated preventative policies to limit virus, including stay-at-home orders that closed businesses, daycares, schools, playgrounds, and limited child learning and typical activities. Fear of infection and possible employment loss has placed stress on parents; while parents who could work from home faced chal-lenges in both working and providing full-time attentive childcare. For pregnant individuals, fear of at-tending prenatal visits also increased maternal stress, anxiety, and depression. Not surprising, there has been concern over how these factors, as well as missed educational opportunities and reduced interaction, stimulation, and creative play with other children might impact child neurodevelopment. Lev-eraging a large on-going longitudinal study of child neurodevelopment, we examined general childhood cognitive scores in 2020 and 2021 vs. the preceding decade, 2011-2019. We find that children born during the pandemic have significantly reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance com-pared to children born pre-pandemic. Moreover, we find that males and children in lower socioeconom-ic families have been most affected.

A Review”

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2783051

Abstract
Importance  The COVID-19 pandemic saw one of the fastest developments of vaccines in an effort to combat an out-of-control pandemic. The 2 most common COVID-19 vaccine platforms currently in use, messenger RNA (mRNA) and adenovirus vector, were developed on the basis of previous research in use of this technology. Postauthorization surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines has identified safety signals, including unusual cases of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis reported in recipients of adenoviral vector vaccines. One of the devastating manifestations of this syndrome, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). This review summarizes the current evidence and indications regarding biology, clinical characteristics, and pharmacological management of VITT with CVST.
Observations  VITT appears to be similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with both disorders associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and presence of autoantibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Unlike VITT, HIT is triggered by recent exposure to heparin. Owing to similarities between these 2 conditions and lack of high-quality evidence, interim recommendations suggest avoiding heparin and heparin analogues in patients with VITT. Based on initial reports, female sex and age younger than 60 years were identified as possible risk factors for VITT. Treatment consists of therapeutic anticoagulation with nonheparin anticoagulants and prevention of formation of autoantibody-PF4 complexes, the latter being achieved by administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG). Steroids, which can theoretically inhibit the production of new antibodies, have been used in combination with IVIG. In severe cases, plasma exchange should be used for clearing autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and eculizumab, can be considered when other therapies fail. Routine platelet transfusions, aspirin, and warfarin should be avoided because of the possibility of worsening thrombosis and magnifying bleeding risk.
Conclusions and Relevance  Adverse events like VITT, while uncommon, have been described despite vaccination remaining the most essential component in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. While it seems logical to consider the use of types of vaccines (eg, mRNA-based administration) in individuals at high risk, treatment should consist of therapeutic anticoagulation mostly with nonheparin products and IVIG.",p28dsg,p28dsg,icloudbug,1,covid19

It's in a bunch of other species, yes. *Generally speaking*, passing backwards and forwards between species like that tends to reduce fitness (pass to a cat, spend a while evolving to be better at replicating within cats, lose some traits that were beneficial in humans).

Viral mutations happen randomly when viruses reproduce. Only real way to stop it is to stop it's reproduction.

The reason we see variants at all is the shear viral mass of this thing. Once infected, this thing reproduces like crazy. Huge viral load means it's kills and spreads. Couple that with the millions of people that have had it, and you can do that math. If this was a more rapidly evolving virus (like influenza), we would have seen dozens of variants by now.

We also present a promising tool to forecast new COVID-19 outbreaks. The Tajima D test, an evolutionary algorithm, with a threshold value of -2.50 is shown to be an accurate predictor of new outbreaks.

h8h6yqs,1628641742.0,psychotopography,"New data from Massachusetts public health officials reveals that a significant majority of fully vaccinated people who died after a coronavirus breakthrough infection had underlying conditions that made them more likely to have a severe case.

Also, the median age of Massachusetts vaccine breakthrough cases who died has been 82.5 years, according to the new data from the state Department of Public Health.

There have been 100 breakthrough case deaths in the Bay State, which is 0.002% of all fully vaccinated individuals, or about two for every 100,000 residents who got their shots. More than 4.3 million people in the state have been fully vaccinated.

Of the 100 breakthrough case deaths, 73% of these cases were reported to have underlying conditions that made them more likely to have severe disease.

Overall, there have been 395 breakthrough hospitalizations, which is 0.009% of all fully vaccinated individuals. Of the 395 hospitalizations, 57% of these patients were reported to have underlying conditions.


This new data is comparable to the data of breakthrough cases in other countries, said Davidson Hamer, a Boston University specialist in infectious diseases.

“The breakthrough cases that are sick enough to be hospitalized is generally older people and those with underlying conditions and who are immunocompromised,” Hamer said. “So the people who need to be really careful right now is older people and those who have underlying conditions and those who are immunocompromised.”

Breakthrough cases have been rising in Massachusetts in recent weeks amid the spread of the more highly contagious delta variant.

The state last week reported that 7,737 fully vaccinated people have tested positive for COVID-19, a jump of 1,364 cases in one week, or a daily average of 195 cases.

The 7,737 breakthrough cases is 0.18% of the 4.3 million fully vaccinated people in Massachusetts.

“Breakthrough cases in Massachusetts are incredibly low, and those hospitalized or who have died are even lower,” the DPH said in a statement. “All available data continue to support that all 3 vaccines used in the US are highly protective against severe disease and death from all known variants of COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is to get vaccinated.”

Deaths from breakthrough infections is “very uncommon,” said Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health.

“But when it happens, it’s usually those who are elderly or immunocompromised,” Ellerin said, stressing, “The vaccine has shown that it’s been extremely protective in the elderly.”",p21zs4,p21zs4,psychotopography,1,covid19

This is a knowledge gap because a history of previous infection was an exclusion criterion in phase 3 vaccine trials (1). Countries have adopted diverse approaches—among them, the UK policy to maximize deployment of first doses to the largest possible number of people by extending the time interval to second dose. At the end of 2020, it became apparent that several virus variants had emerged (2, 3) and that these might affect vaccine rollout. The B.1.1.7 variant, possessing the spike Asn501→Tyr (N501Y) mutation, first emerged in the UK in December 2020 and spread rapidly (4). Additional variants of concern (VOC) include the B.1.351 variant, which emerged at about the same time in South Africa, and the P.1 variant, which emerged in January 2021 in Brazil. In addition to the N501Y mutation, both of these variants have the E484K mutation, which is implicated in escape from neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) (5, 6).",p1ye85,p1ye85,Puzzleheaded_Basil13,1,covid19

STUDY QUESTION
Does the immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine involve the ovarian follicle, and does it affect its function?

SUMMARY ANSWER
We were able to demonstrate anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2) IgG in follicular fluid (FF) from both infected and vaccinated IVF patients, with no evidence for compromised follicular function.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
No research data are available yet.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
This is a cohort study, composed of 32 consecutive IVF patients, either infected with COVID-19, vaccinated or non-exposed, conducted between 1 February and 10 March 2021 in a single university hospital-based IVF clinic.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
A consecutive sample of female consenting patients undergoing oocyte retrieval was recruited and assigned to one of the three study groups: recovering from confirmed COVID-19 (n = 9); vaccinated (n = 9); and uninfected, non-vaccinated controls (n = 14). Serum and FF samples were taken and analyzed for anti-COVID IgG as well as estrogen, progesterone and heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 concentration, as well as the number and maturity of aspirated oocytes and day of trigger estrogen and progesterone measurements. Main outcome measures were follicular function, including steroidogenesis, follicular response to the LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarkers.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Both COVID-19 and the vaccine elicited anti-COVID IgG antibodies that were detected in the FF at levels proportional to the IgG serum concentration. No differences between the three groups were detected in any of the surrogate parameters for ovarian follicle quality.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
This is a small study, comprising a mixed fertile and infertile population, and its conclusions should be supported and validated by larger studies.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS

This is the first study to examine the impact of SARS–Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination on ovarian function and these early findings suggest no measurable detrimental effect on function of the ovarian follicle.

Very small study, but sounds promising.",p1uu2a,p1uu2a,icloudbug,1,covid19

Understanding the impact of prior infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the response to vaccination is a priority for responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In particular, it is necessary to understand how prior infection plus vaccination can modulate immune responses against variants of concern. To address this, we sampled 20 individuals with and 25 individuals without confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from a large cohort of healthcare workers followed serologically since April 2020. All 45 individuals had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BTN162b2 vaccine with a delayed booster at 10 weeks. Absolute and neutralizing antibody titers against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were measured using enzyme immunoassays and pseudotype neutralization assays. We observed antibody reactivity against lineage A, B.1.351 and P.1 variants with increasing antigenic exposure, either through vaccination or natural infection. This improvement was further confirmed in neutralization assays using fixed dilutions of serum samples. The impact of antigenic exposure was more evident in enzyme immunoassays measuring SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific IgG antibody concentrations. Our data show that multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the context of a delayed booster expand the neutralizing breadth of the antibody response to neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants.

h8fdwmk,1628613102.0,BillyGrier,"**Abstract**  
  
The capacity of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants is currently of high relevance to assess the protection against infections. We performed a cell culture-based neutralization assay focusing on authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), all harboring the spike substitution L452R. We found that authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring L452R had reduced susceptibility to convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera and mAbs. Compared to B.1, Kappa and Delta showed a reduced neutralization by convalescent sera by a factor of 5.71 and 3.64, respectively, which constitutes a 2-fold greater reduction when compared to Epsilon. BNT2b2 and mRNA1273 vaccine-elicited sera were less effective against Kappa, Delta, and Epsilon compared to B.1. No difference was observed between Kappa and Delta towards vaccine-elicited sera, whereas convalescent sera were 1.6-fold less effective against Delta, respectively. Both B.1.617 variants Kappa (+E484Q) and Delta (+T478K) were less susceptible to either casirivimab or imdevimab. In conclusion, in contrast to the parallel circulating Kappa variant, the neutralization efficiency of convalescent and vaccine-elicited sera against Delta was moderately reduced. Delta was resistant to imdevimab, which however, might be circumvented by a combination therapy with casirivimab together.",p1ssl0,p1ssl0,BillyGrier,1,covid19
h8femva,1628613404.0,BillyGrier,"From discussion:  
  ______  
The position E484 on the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S is a well-described immunodominant site [6, 29-31]. In this work, we detected a lower capacity of convalescent or vaccine-elicited sera to neutralize the E484Q-carrying variant Kappa matching the previously shown reduced neutralization of variants Beta and Zeta carrying E484K (Wideraet al. 2021). Hence, both substitutions E484K and E484Q might limit the sensitivity of SARSCoV-2 to neutralizing antibodies.  
  
Specifically, using convalescent but not vaccine-elicited sera Kappa was neutralized 1.6-fold less effective than the T478K-carrying Delta variant . The T478K substitution appears more relevant for neutralization by convalescent sera. Thus, or data suggests that mRNA-based vaccination confers better protection against both B.1.617 strains when compared to convalescent sera.",p1ssl0,h8fdwmk,BillyGrier,2,covid19

Nearly all studies measuring vaccine response in immunosuppressed individuals just measure antibody response even though we know most patients on B-cell depleting therapies will have little or no antibody response.

Rituximab has been found to unexpectedly and substantially deplete T-cells in some patients ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918413/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918413/)), but this very recent study showed that a robust T-cell response can be mounted even in the absence of circulating B cells. [https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2021/07/19/annrheumdis-2021-220781](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2021/07/19/annrheumdis-2021-220781). Still, in about a third of the patients, there was no antibody OR T-cell response. (See Dr. Lindsay Ryan's personal account of this here [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781012](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781012))

What I want to understand is how can immunosuppressed folks be empowered to predict their response to vaccination? The BMJ paper essentially says there's about a 1 in 3 chance the vaccine offers no protection - but 2 in 3 that it does ain't bad. As COVID-19 becomes endemic, immunosuppressed people need to understand what vaccination means for them.

The BMJ study linked above considered a number of patient characteristics that may be associated with T-cell response, and found that only time since last rituximab treatment reached statistical significance. Could we expect that this is directly related to T-cell counts if we wanted a more discrete measurement? i.e. If a patient has normal CD8+ T cell population at time of vaccination, could that person expect to mount a T-cell response or is there some other mechanism by which a patient receiving rituximab who has high CD8+ T cell counts could fail to produce spike-specific CD8+ T cells?",p1nhjr,p1nhjr,bobbyioaloha,1,covid19

* fitness effects of some particular amount of virus in the air being more or less good at infecting someone *ceteris paribus*
* fitness effects of how well the virus reproduces after infection -- abstracts as generation time/how quickly you're shedding enough virus to matter, but also faster reproduction may interact differently with the immune system and the particulars of how the disease progresses, etc.
