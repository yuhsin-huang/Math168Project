Here are some links of articles some peer reviewed, some news articles about peer reviewed and one great post on Reddit with a ton of links about the safety of the covid vaccines. 

The thing about all vaccine approvals is that unlike medications, our threshold for tolerating side effects and harms is very low when it comes to vaccines. This is because we are generally giving them to otherwise 'healthy' people, ie: people without the disease. Whereas with medications, we tolerate a lot more serious side effects because you already have the disease and getting the med which might help save you can also cause harm, but doing nothing would be worse. 

It would be horrible to give a bunch of healthy people a vaccine and have a lot of bad complications. That wouldn't make much sense. This is why vaccines are notoriously safe and well studied. 

This is why it's so frustrating when we physicians who know about the efficacy of vaccines, see patients asking about getting dangerous antibiotics rather than getting the HiB or meningococcal vaccines or when they want that horrible drug Tamiflu instead of getting the flu shot, etc. 

The vaccines are incredibly safe, safer than any medication you've ever taken or been prescribed on the planet. I guarantee it.

Too many power hungry or brainwashed doctors out there who apart of all this mess. I have seen it firsthand and so have many other professionals. Once you seek these sources out I hope that you understand a bit more from where I am coming from. There is a plethora of scientists, doctors, immunologists, etc. who are telling the people we are being manipulated in a way that no one could possibly imagine. Hell, even the former VP and Chief Scientist of PFIZER, Dr. Michael Yeadon is trying to tell us our Gov. is lying to us ([https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/exclusive-former-pfizer-vp-your-government-is-lying-to-you-in-a-way-that-could-lead-to-your-death/](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/exclusive-former-pfizer-vp-your-government-is-lying-to-you-in-a-way-that-could-lead-to-your-death/))

Here's more that I **strongly** encourage you to look into - regardless of all the Government drones that are about to be in my replies hitting me with every talking point the media has fed them with, don't feed into it. Think critically.

After all, it is well known now that none of these vaxxines produce ""sterilizing immunity"". Meaning, people who have been jabbed can (and do) still spread c0vid. With that, now we are on our third round of booster shots, and hospital employees here in America are being asked to take one every 8 months? Clearly, they are not as effective as they had told us, right?

The choice of vaccination is not like sexual orientation at all. Your choice in sexual orientation cannot impact the health of people just for being physically close to you. 

Think Of it more like smoking cigarettes indoors. You are not allowed in restaurants, movie theaters, retail stores, etc if you are smoking because that smoke can lead to adverse health affects for everyone else in the room. Same goes with not being vaccinated. If you aren’t vaccinated, you have an exponentially higher chance of carrying Covid and getting viral loads everywhere, that can then infect others.

If you're vaccinated, you're not 100% immune to covid. Even if you get multiple vaccines, you still have a chance of catching and spreading covid. The world isn't black and white like that (and microbiology is *definitely not*).

The point of getting vaccinated is to lessen the chance, both of catching and spreading it. Not to mention the vaccine has been shown to deter some of the long term effects of covid, like lung scarring, fatigue, brain fogs, erectile dysfunction, ect.

The problem with the vaccine hesitant and this virus is it spreads fast among people who can't fend it off, and each body infected is a new chance at a mutation. If a strain that's much stronger than past mutations pops up, it could be stronger than our current vaccines. Meaning vaccine creation would be at square 1.

TL:DR if large groups of unprotected(unvaccinated) people spread a virus enough, it'll mutate stronger than current vaccines. Thus making the vaccines useless (very bad).",pew7wj,hb3xd8k,Fantastic_Look6831,2

One is due to pregnancy: vaccine studies are never tested on pregnant woman so effects are not known

Another is Newborn children: same reason as above *plus* their immune system is basically non existant at that point so a vaccine could be very dangerous in that stage (i believe there are some exceptions though)

hb2n1wr,1630426425.0,Music_Adventure,"That is really just a matter of opinion. And an incorrect one at that. It is all well and good to provide your opinion on things like morality, or if certain food tastes yummy to you. Calling the vaccine a poison shot with no redeeming qualities is just wrong. And that’s not a matter of opinion. that is fact.

Some redeeming qualities:
	-Because the vaccine conveys nearly complete immunity to the original variants, and a good response but not complete immunity to the delta variant, by getting vaccinated you are 1) saving yourself from the virus that caused the first wave of deaths and 2) dramatically reducing the symptoms you would have if you contract the delta variant
	- If you get vaccinated but your other friend who thinks it’s “poison” doesn’t, then if you both get infected with delta, you can have some mild symptoms and wait it out at home, while your friend can get an ICU bed and be put on a ventilator, and get their life saved, because you didn’t need to.
	-Do you have kids under 12? Getting vaccinated yourself could save their life. How about older, immune-compromised family? You could be saving their lives too. Friends who smoke, drink, or exercise as much as they should? Great news, getting vaccinated can reduce the risk they contract covid and could save them from having far worse symptoms of the disease because of comorbidity. 

Some redeeming qualities to not getting vaccinated:
	-You can continue to push your own agenda that is not based in any sort of relevant fact, and you can post that to areas of the internet that will constantly affirm your heinously incorrect statement.
	-You can get to see Darwinism at work in real time.
	-You can get infected with ANY variant of covid, which could be seen as some sort of “inclusive” perspective.
	-God forbid you DO contract covid, you can be a first-hand witness to the horrors that this disease is bringing to intensive care units across the country. Need a bed? Maybe you can get a double-wide chair in the waiting room; all the beds are full. Can’t breathe on your own? I hope you can be put on a ventilator that will save your life. Are you one of the lucky ones that survives it? Great, now it’s time to drown in  medical debt. I figure if healthcare professionals are urging people to get the vaccine so you don’t die, but you think its poison, its probably likely you don’t “buy in” to the “conspiracy” of health insurance.

Everyone is entitled to an opinion. But being able to express that opinion should go out the window when that opinion directly risks the lives of others. Please get vaccinated. If you really are interested in seeing when poison is ACTUALLY used in medicine, go get a really bad fungal infection. You can get an injection of amphotericin B, what doctors like to call “amphoterrible”.",peo4ot,hb0q0k2,BrickTamblan,2

Antibodies do decrease with time, tyically within several months before they're basically useless, although they can still be detected in bloodsamples in negligible amounts. Adding to this, previously infected individuals have varying immune responses when compared to others.

2)as a 26 year old the threat of covid to me is statistically zero
3) natural immunity is real despite the governments gaslighting
4) ivermectin works, there’s plenty of observable data on this, check out the work of Dr Pierre Kory (sOuRcE pLeAsE)
5) the FDA is corrupt and protects corporations before it protects public health (re: countless harmful drugs that were approved and been recalled.)
6) not one single person has come on TV and told you to eat better, exercise more, sleep more, get sunlight, etc. 75%+ of deaths are obese people, and they’ve had 18 months to get healthier but instead were just told to stay inside and wear a mask. Does that seem like health or fear is a priority?
7) when you have to censor doctors, medical researchers, and  scientific data that opposes the government paradigm, you are no longer using “science”, you are pushing a cult like narrative
8) the virus came from the Wuhan lab, and social media companies banned anyone talking about it in the beginning cause god forbid you think outside the accepted narrative 
9) Dr Fauci is corrupt, just research “gain of function research”. His emails showed he knew masks didn’t work but tells us to wear them anyways. When rand Paul questioned him his only rebuttal was “you don’t know what you’re talking about!” And the sheep applauded him because it was “sassy” and “relatable”
10) moderna, Pfizer, and J&J all have a history of putting profits over public health. There are settlements and recalls to prove it. Now, they had all their liability taken away and every incentive to rush the vaccine to rake in billions of freshly printed government dollars

Do I know what the vaccine will do to me long term? No. Do I think it magnetizes you or puts a microchip in you or makes you infertile? I have no idea. But it is clear it doesn’t even stop the spread, or stop you from contracting the virus. So why, would I accept the potential risks of a rushed vaccine, when I have natural antibodies For a virus that is no threat to me anyway? To “do my part”? Just get a booster every 6 months forever? No thanks. Why do you care though? Let us all die right?

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The original post may be from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

Imagine that? The most educated and most intelligent of us don't want to be used as lab rats with an experimental vaccine that has already killed 30,000 between the U.S. & Europe and horrifically injured over a million just in the U.S. alone with long term consequences a complete unknown for some bizarre experimental completely new type of 'vaccine' never before used on humans. **Vaccines have always been pulled from the market if there are more than 25 deaths.

When exactly did it become acceptable that over 30,000 DIE and over a million seriously injured from a vaccine? Oh, that's right, because Pfizer and Moderna say that's acceptable- we wouldn't want to hurt their quarterly profits. And of course the CDC & FDA are heavily invested in the vaccines as well financially and there is a revolving door between these agencies and pharma companies, mostly the same people controlling both.

We did the actual research - we didn't use Google and 'fact checks' as the typical lazy form of research, not to even mention this entire 'pandemic' didn't pass the smell test and was easy to see it was a hoax to begin all being used for political purposes, something your lower intelligence simply cannot comprehend and of course you actually believe corporate media.  
  
Most doctors know the covid was a hoax and these experimental vaccines are dangerous and have never been perfected and have been considered a failure for decades, but the ones who speak up are either smeared in the media or threatened and/or censored in the mainstream media. Here is one of the most credentialed doctors in Canada explaining 'covid' and this 'pandemic' is nothing more than a hoax: Dr. Roger Hodkinson's credentials: **""Fellow at the Royal college of physicians and surgeons of Canada, medical degrees from Cambridge University in the UK and has held a number of significant positions including being an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, president of the Association of Physicians.""**

- protects you from contracting the virus by priming your immune system to be able to fight it. Efficacy for this is around 70-95% depending on vaccine and variant. A 90% efficacy essentially a means that an unvaccinated person is 10x more likely to contract vs a vaccinated. 95% efficacy is a 20:1 ratio. 
- protects against serious illness if it fails to prevent infection. Since your body is primed already, it still responds much quicker so the virus doesn’t infect you as bad or get as deep into your system (for example not reaching your lungs). This means the illness will be milder and not last as long. 
- reduces your chances of spreading the virus by lessening the length you have the virus (if at all) since your body is primed to fight it off.

The most educated and most intelligent of us don't want to be used as lab rats with an experimental vaccine that has already killed 30,000 between the U.S. & Europe and horrifically injured over a million just in the U.S. alone with long term consequences a complete unknown. Vaccines have always been pulled from the market **if there are more than 25 deaths. The swine flu vaccine was halted after only 3 deaths:** [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/13/archives/swine-flu-prograrm-is-halted-in-9-states-as-3-die-after-shots.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/13/archives/swine-flu-prograrm-is-halted-in-9-states-as-3-die-after-shots.html) .. 

**When exactly did it become acceptable that over 30,000 DIE and over a million seriously injured from a vaccine?** Oh, that's right, because Pfizer and Moderna say that's acceptable- we wouldn't want to hurt their quarterly profits. And of course the CDC & FDA are heavily invested in the vaccines as well financially and there is a revolving door between these agencies and pharma companies, mostly the same people controlling both. **The real question is what is wrong with all of you people who accept this insanity? Have you lost your minds?** 

Your friends have done the actual research - they didn't use Google and 'fact checks' as the typical lazy form of research, not to even mention this entire 'pandemic' didn't pass the smell test and was easy to see it was a hoax to begin all being used for political purposes, something your lower intelligence simply cannot comprehend and of course you actually believe corporate media. 

Most doctors know the covid was a hoax and the vaccine is dangerous, but the ones who speak up are either smeared in the media or threatened and/or censored in the mainstream media. Here is one of the most credentialed doctors in Canada explaining 'covid' and this 'pandemic' is nothing more than a hoax: Dr. Roger Hodkinson's credentials: **""Fellow at the Royal college of physicians and surgeons of Canada, medical degrees from Cambridge University in the UK and has held a number of significant positions including being an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, president of the Association of Physicians.""**

My plan is to wait until some of the long term side effects have chance to show (most vaccines tend to have long term side effects to begin with. I can’t find a website explaining it atm because everything related to vaccines just shows about the covid vaccine but when I was in school we learnt about how vaccines work and how they are made. I was taught that there are immediate side effects, short term side effect which show within weeks/months and the long term side effects that can show in the following years and this is how they then further develop vaccines by looking at these side effects and altering vaccines so they don’t happen as often) once there has been chance for some longer term side effects to show I will then be considering it, or if myself or anyone in my family is unfortunate enough to become extremely vulnerable. 

I don’t force my views on anyone as I’m a massive believer in your body your choice. I make sure to let people know I’m unvaccinated before I see them and ask that they are still happy and comfortable to see me etc so that I don’t effect others :) however I have been attacked quite a lot for my views on the vaccine by people who are strong believers in it.

Imagine that? The most educated and most intelligent of us don't want to be used as lab rats with an experimental vaccine that has already killed 30,000 between the U.S. & Europe and horrifically injured over a million just in the U.S. alone with long term consequences a complete unknown. **Vaccines have always been pulled from the market if there are more than 25 deaths**. **The swine flu vaccine was halted after only 3 deaths:** [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/13/archives/swine-flu-prograrm-is-halted-in-9-states-as-3-die-after-shots.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/13/archives/swine-flu-prograrm-is-halted-in-9-states-as-3-die-after-shots.html) ..

**When exactly did it become acceptable that over 30,000 DIE and over a million seriously injured from a vaccine?** Oh, that's right, because Pfizer and Moderna say that's acceptable- we wouldn't want to hurt their quarterly profits. And of course the CDC & FDA are heavily invested in the vaccines as well financially and there is a revolving door between these agencies and pharma companies, mostly the same people controlling both.

**The real question is what is wrong with all of you people who accept this insanity? Have you lost your minds?** Your friend has done the actual research - she didn't use Google and 'fact checks' as the typical lazy form of research, not to even mention this entire 'pandemic' didn't pass the smell test and was easy to see it was a hoax to begin all being used for political purposes, something your lower intelligence simply cannot comprehend and of course you actually believe corporate media.

Most doctors know the covid was a hoax and these experimental vaccines are dangerous and have never been perfected and have been considered a failure for decades, but the ones who speak up are either smeared in the media or threatened and/or censored in the mainstream media. Here is one of the most credentialed doctors in Canada explaining 'covid' and this 'pandemic' is nothing more than a hoax: Dr. Roger Hodkinson's credentials: **""Fellow at the Royal college of physicians and surgeons of Canada, medical degrees from Cambridge University in the UK and has held a number of significant positions including being an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, president of the Association of Physicians.""**

• Zinc / Zinc Ionophore approach inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) 

• RDRP is essential for some RNA viruses such as: 

• all the Corona virus strains 
• all the influenza strains 
• RSV 

Zinc Ionophores include: 

• Hydroxychloroquine 
• Ivermectin 
• Quercetin 
• EGCG 

We can potentially cure all Corona, Influenza, and RSV infections with a safe, cheap, and oral treatment approach. 

This is why the Globalists, Pharmaceutical industry, tyrants, despots, and devolved pagans are opposing this is approach. 

It undermines their agenda, profits, and the use of fear as a weapon. 

We must resist and sacrifice at all costs and win the war for God consciousness and freedom from tyranny.

Ivermectin Docks to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-binding Domain Attached to ACE2

Ivermectin may block the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor in the human cell membrane, as explained in the article “Ivermectin Docks to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-binding Domain Attached to ACE2,” published by in vivo, the journal of the International Institute of Anticancer Research.

That research is also supported by this study which similarly found that ivermectin can inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor. Source and Study

Being that this current “vaccine” has had the highest death rate of any vaccine in recorded history (even with all the cover ups and nonsense denial of the vax having anything to do with people suddenly dying days to weeks later as an obvious result of the vaccine due to consistencies in type of death), I wouldn’t say it’s safe… VAERS data on covid vaccine 2021 deaths and damages is a good place to start. Estimated to be 1-10% of the actual number. So as far as deaths the number could be anywhere from 50,000-5 MILLION. And damages are through the roof. You know there have been vaccines that have been pulled from the public after *25 deaths*. TWENTY FIVE.

Covid-19 isn’t an illness like Polio, it would be very difficult to erradicate so it would become closer to a flu since people are getting vaccinated right now and we get some protection against the effects of the virus.

Moderna is a company that wants to grow and their objective is quite high compared to what happened in the field they are in (so they’re ambitious)

Back in 2011 they weren’t sure if mRNA could actually be used to create vaccines and they needed to research it (they did and found it was safe and how to use it)

His anecdote with his wife is more to show that he didn’t know how it worked and if it was safe (he thought 5% chance it was safe)

He explains that this bit of technology was worth researching because it might change medicine in a good way since it opens a lot of doors in the field

He explains that once you make it work you can make it multiple times

hav8cm3,1630281571.0,SharkAttackOmNom,"New variants doesn’t spell disaster the immunity you have already acquired. Your immune system is just trying to identify dangerous particles and uses it’s past experience to eliminate it.

Delta has the same spike protein that mRNA vaccines target to train your body. Delta just also seems to aggressively multiply compared to the OG virus. So there’s a chance that your encounter with COVID could break through your immune system.

But your immune system would be better prepared to fight COVID. The vaccine is showing to be very effective at reducing the need for hospitalization or the occurrence of death. Just because it doesn’t work out for some people isn’t justification to totally skip the vax.

You mentioned staying home when you are sick. Thanks for that, it’s surprising how many people go to work/school when they *know* that they’re sick. But here is the clear cut problem with COVID. There is a huge occurrence of people have NO SYMPTOMS (no clue that they’re sick) while having enough viral load of COVID to be contagious. They may get symptoms later, but early on there were none.  Unfortunately your policy of staying home while sick is no longer a reliable policy.

By getting the shot, you would likely not get COVID at all. If you did acquire COVID, you would likely not be hospitalized or even contagious. (Certainly not as contagious as someone without the vax).

What we are experiencing now is the utilization of fear and chaos to implement an experimental medicine on a global scale and a whole bunch of people would rather turn off the critical thought portion of their brain in exchange for the ability to virtue signal and feel smarter or better then someone else based on information a for profit pharmaceutical company provides you.",pdu5qb,pdu5qb,Doodlastic_Dinkaling,1

Literally just google this, it's not that hard. 3) ""You can't tell me what to do""  is not critical thought. That's literally acting like a toddler. Critical thought is taking an objective risk assessment. Getting the vaccine means that you are almost guaranteed to not be hospitalized/severely sick from Covid. Getting Covid + being on a ventilator + losing renal function/needing dialysis is virtually a death sentence. It's common sense homie.

The fact that they (government/world leaders) have been lying to all of us for over 100 years and we keep eating their glitter encrusted bullshit.

And then per usual, the government/world powers saw an in to begin their totalitarian regimes, taking something of innocent scientific curiosity and weaponising it at a bio hazard pandemic so they could ""legally/willfully"" begin fear mongering the masses into hysteria and candle herding us to our death by injecting us.

However! None of that will matter in the coming years. As we transition more into the Age of Aquarius or The Golden Age, we will liberate ourselves from the mental and physical enslavement that has been conditioned into humans for centuries and a couple millennia. Global consciousness is raising as a whole and those who follow the path of the heart, will be saved and liberated of fear, pain, deceit and mass slavery. 

Welcoming in the 5D reality that we all deserve and are already a part of. But it's a matter of shifting your consciousness to that higher frequency of awareness and embracing the love that penetrates us all. 

Regardless of what you may believe or think, I am thankful for you and your experience as a human vessel in this time because it is a necessary one. It's necessary for each of us to have our own understanding of human experience as the universe IS us, viewing itself through Itself(you), so it can learn more about itself, to understand itself as a whole. 

Each experience is necessary for conscious evolution. Not every experience is rainbows and sunshine. But each is unique and as equally valuable as the next. No one human experience is superior to the next or last. But those that have the awareness of a unified consciousness are not the ones who will physically suffer in this human experience.  

Much love to all. 
But fuck the jab. 
Not happening in this human experience.

She met all of her milestones before her brother. She sat up first, crawled first, walked first and spoke words first.  At the tender age of 15 months I had my babies vaccinated.  I begged their pediatrician to only give one vaccination at a time.  I was told that was impossible in the state of NJ.  She injected them with four vaccinations that day. MMR and Polio.  Both of them got severely ill that night. Fever, nausea, vomiting and were very lethargic.  I called their doctor and she simply said they must have the flu. Pretty coincidental.  I took them to the hospital that evening. It took two weeks for them to get over the ""flu"".  My son bounced back as he was the bigger stronger twin. My daughter lost all eye contact with us as well as all of the words she had been saying up to that point.  She has never been the same.  As far as my reasons for not getting the vaccine....I had Coviid-19 in February of this year.  I recovered at home in less than two weeks. I did not have a fever nor any breathing problems.  My  back hurt and I was very tired.  My husband nor my children were affected and we all live under the same roof.  Because of the masking laws in this state, I have had three eye infections and upper respiratory infections from consistently breathing in my own carbon dioxide.  Now my twins are being forced to wear masks all day long in an unairconditioned school in overcrowded classrooms for close to seven hours daily.  Both of my children have gotten Titer tests and thankfully are healthy with strong immune systems.  Neither of them have had vaccinations since they were 11 years old.

Most antivaxers are not suicidal because they are trying to be safe and messing up, not trying to die, but the person you described sounds like their intent is to die

This is a really ineffective way to commit suicide, as most people with covid recover, and those that don't recover are more likely to be left disabled than dead

Some would call me stupid for looking at the Non-vaccine side, but I’m just being cautious and all this information coming out about how it’s so bad isn’t helping.

Thats what the vaccine is for. It's intended to provoke your immune system into creating antibodies BEFORE said foreign agent finds its way into you. So when that does happen, your immune system is already active and looking for what ever the vaccine provoked it into attacking.

Because of the nature of our current situation with COVID, current vaccines for it that are using the spike protein have been designed to provoke the immune system into not looking for a specific strain of disease or virus like a typical vaccine does, but instead provokes it into creating more generalized antibodies that will attack anything on sight that isn't already part of your normal body system. This is part of why it's been pointed out that even though Delta can still be contracted by vaccinated people, they have less of a chance of the strain doing anything significant, since their immune systems have already been provoked into immediately attacking anything that enters your body.",pc8kb2,pc8kb2,DrFaucci,1

I see a veteran admin psychologist quarterly conslcerning my traumatic brain injury, PTSD, ADHD, and other issues after an explosion that put me a coma for three months.

We had some charts and graphs about how the immune system responds to an infection with and without a vaccine. Just stuff like that. But this is hours of lecture.

hac3kn5,1629922277.0,Plenty-Acadia-1181,"MRNA vaccines have never been widely consumed by human beings. That is a fact. MRNA basically gives your body instructions on how to make proteins. This is much different than most common vaccines, which use a weakened version of the virus, rather than a literally piece of genetic coding. We really have no clue at all HOW MUCH, OR WHERE any of these ""spike proteins"" are going. Noone knows. Not the cdc. The fda. Who knows. Please tell me. There is a fixed amount of mrna being injected, but the quantity of proteins that are produced by said mrna has not been fully studied. The truth is that the vaccine hasnt even been out a year, and that is obviously not nearly enough time to conduct the proper clinical trials to answer these questions. There is a reason why it HAS NEVER BEEN APPROVED (despite being studied). Which is that there is a huge risk to injecting people with mRNA. If these ""spike proteins"" production isnt halted quickly enough, it will cause serious tissue degradation wherever they accumulate. Practically every known neurodegenerative disease is caused by protein accumulation (alzheimers, cjd, etc.). Some peoples bodies produce proteins at higher rates than others so its not like everyone will start experiencing side effects all at once. Estimates I have heard from various medical professionals who are against the vaccine are a 2 year average life expectancy after the injection. They are rushing everyone to get the jab because that 2 year mark is coming up real soon. People will start to realize they made a  mistake and then noone will take anymore vaccines. People are turning themselves into lab rats by the masses, it feels like we are in a movie. On a final note because i feel like i could go on forever. WE NEED A CONTROL GROUP. This is common sense.

However it's nice to hear that someone wants to know the reasons.
My first reason is mistrust in governments. If they would really care so much about people's health, they wouldn't stop seeing people with other more critical conditions yet to be diagnosed because of covid. So I know that their reason isn't about health. So what is the reason? Who knows. I don't want to talk about any conspiracy theories because absolutely noone knows for sure right now what is this all about.
The unknown and the mistrust is why I don't want it.

Second reason are potential side effects. Not only short time, but long time side effects. There hasn't been enough time to test the vaccine for long ones.
About the FDA approval, I would just say watch the documentary ""Bleeding edge"" on Netflix and get your own conclusions about how much their approvals are legitimate. Lots of people had their lives ruined for some other approved medical treatments that have been approved by the same FDA.

In conclusion, I would say right now I don't trust governments who are pushing so much to get it with threats and other methods, the scary statistics about people died from Covid but not scary statistics about people having issues after getting the vaccine (yes there are lots of people, some of them I even know personally). Why they're hiding that and not promoting those issues on tv, why they're so selective about it. Why suddenly when Covid started free speech and questioning the vaccine isn't allowed anymore?

I know it's not 0, and I know I could die from it next week and a bunch of vax zealots are going to be clapping their hands in glee. And that's ok. On the other side, there is a rushed vaccine (not necessarily a bad thing) that my government is buying en masse from a group of people I despise deeply (big pharmaceuticals companies) with my money. The same people (Silicone Valley&co) who beat the drum of feminism, anti-racism, mass immigration and other things  I have judged to be great evils are now trying to drown any criticism, no matter how well or poorly founded, of the brand new vaccine. Even within the Science Cult, they disagree on what the Truth about Covid is. And so, I just shrug, shiver a bit seeing how easy the society I live in is to manipulate, and go on about my day. I have always washed my hands before eating, and I keep doing it. When we have mandatory masking, I just aim for malicious compliance, I use a neck gater thing, and nobody seems to have a problem with a covering that aerosolizes my breath even more than not wearing one. When it comes to opinions I am not allowed to have by law, I am very skeptical and normally side with the illegal opinion. I would be very open to a campaign honestly explaining the tradeoffs, there is NO WAY this vaccine is 100% perfect and has no side effects and no long term consequences.

I know a guy who has actually had a guillain-barre reaction to a vaccine in the past and would get vaccinated against covid but he’s been told not to by his doctors. I know another man who has had life-threatening reactions to the flu shot in the past. He has heart issues and is really concerned about getting covid but he’s been seeing doctors for months trying to ascertain his risk/benefit situation and here he is.   

I have another friend who along with her family has a laundry list of health problems completely ignored by mainstream doctors. While I have a very healthy respect for our medical community’s ability to manage serious disease, they have major blind spots, especially with regards to women’s health, especially mental and hormonal.  It is not a major stretch to go from chronically ill and constantly told you just need depression pills or diet pills to being completely anti-doctor.

Most if not all of these people have taken all their vaccines except this one.

They've taken hepatitis. MMR, polio etc, and they don't have to fear people who aren't vaccinated as it doesn't compromise their safety, because the vaccines are effective. 

Then you bring them a vaccine that only works if everyone else has taken it (80% cz herd immunity). Then 80% do take it in many areas which still doesn't give the herd immunity... But here's the catch, being vaccinated means you still have to wear a mask and social distance. The only differnce is that you avoid serious illness and death..

The logic is to not take the vaccine thats new and wait out on adverse side effects (such a heresy to want even quesiton safety ik). The ironic part is that the government's and health Institutes are promoting the vaccine but not treatments or natural ways of improving immunity (which would help you against a variety of viruses as covid isn't the only dangerous one, flu still exists). 

And the vaccine campaigns seem to lack basic science, or our science of centuries has been wrong all along. There is no such vaccine that is stronger than natural immunity. Simply impossible but not with this vaccine! And no one is answering to these basic concerns that every person should have and instead indirectly forcing them to get vaccinated.

Because the general population could not give a fuck about the science

Its confusing, science is a broad field, virology and vaccine development not so much, basically people are just gonna get confused

So they release everything but basically the public announcement version of what tests they done, effectiveness and safety

>there is no vaccine stronger than natural immunity

Not sure if you actually think this but its not true... thats why vaccines exist

Back to what i said how the only way to get natural immunity is to get the disease itself

With stuff like chickenpox thats fine as a kid

But when your 20 and not vaccinated against it and never had it as a kid, it can be one of the worst diseases to worry about

Basically we know kids have a virtually zero chance of death from some diseases so we don’t care if you get the disease as a kid or the vaccine.. it will basically do the same thing

Of course that's not true. Every drug has side effects. Even the most generic, widely used drug can trigger a rare adverse effect in someone.
Is it however better to have vaccines than not have them? Absolutely! We are absolutely swapping a much much worse scenario for something better. No, it won't be 100%. Nothing on biology is. But is it better than without them? No, it's definitely good to have them.

Scientists don't ""silence"" research that uncovers a dangerous side effect. No, it gets evaluatedan incorporated into the guidelines, just like how it happened with AstraZeneca. And once a disease is eradicated, it might become better to stop vaccinatimg for it because at that point the vaccine can cause more illness than the non existent illness itself. This is why they stopped making smallpox vaccine mandatory in my country.

But seemingly not giving a fuck about some side effect that affects 4 people out of 1 million and side eyeing someone who screams ""nobody talks about thos, you must ban vaccines because of this!??"" is not ""cancelling"". It's just not giving disproportiona attention to a piece of data that doesn't change the big picture and therefore doesn't require reconsidering the consensus.

Well if we can agree that consensus does not equal truth and that the medicine could possibly be more harmful than the disease, then it becomes a personal choice, no? It's a risk assessment and therefore people should be able to assess their risks. That also means that people may conclude that it's better for them to not get vaccinated, completely in compliance with science. ""Is it however better to have vaccines than not have them? Absolutely!"" For most, yes, but not all. The people who have died from the vaccines, was it better for them to have the vaccine than not have them? Absolutely not! I mean, I'm glad vaccines are around, at the same time I'm glad the unvaccinated are around. If there's one tiny thing wrong with a vaccination, the entire population could get affected by it. It's good to have unvaccinated around to measure how effective it is.

I didn't mean that scientists silence research, I'm talking about governments and online platforms like twitter and facebook. An american institute has stated that professionals who do anything to go against the vaccination program will experience ""consequences"". I think scientists are a lot more used to engaging with inconvenient facts than normal people are. It's the normal people who are the problem here. 

I didn't say vaccines should be banned, that'd be horrible. I'm pointing to the belief that vaccines are a holy grail and anyone who disagrees is a supposed science denier. And I don't think the people experiencing side effects is 4 in a million. The third to last link I posted goes into how poorly the effects of vaccines are measured. Vaccine producers do some small scale tests before releasing it to the public, but when it has been released there's no follow up research to see how well they actually did and if they matched expectations. They do research in how effective they are, as in they look at the stats of the disease they're fighting dropping, but they're not interested in any new problems that arise out of them. Some of the links I posted go into how bad some vaccines work, but those aren't researches funded by the producer of the vaccination.

If I tried to challenge any of the fundamentals of the field, not only would I not get a job, I would get laughed out of the interview. Especially in an academic field. Students go in, take everything on board uncritically, and walk out regurgitating what they heard in the classroom.

ha60ffp,1629816085.0,clowningAnarchist,"1. There are multiple fields of science. Some of which aim to determine whether or not something is factual. Watering it down to a general term doesn't make what you're saying true.

2. A lot of the misinformation is because antivaxxers misinterpret actual scientific studies that verify vaccines, and twist it out of context to say something it doesn't.

3. Vaccines never have, and likely never will cause autism. That claim is just in and of itself outright false.

4. There's a HUGE difference between correlation and causation. Just because some kids who were vaccinated needed special ed, doesnt mean the vaccination made them less intelligent. (Its more likely that the system failed them, or refused to make exceptions and didn't provide extra help to those who needed it.)

5. Maybe so, but that says REPEATEDLY taking the herpes vaccine. If you keep taking painkillers when you've already taken them, and you do it too often, you can overdose. That doesnt mean the meds are bad, it's more likely the person taking them took too much, too soon.

6. That HPV one is just an outright exaggeration. It doesn't seem to take into account whether or not those cases were directly because of it, or if it just happened to be after they got the vaccine.

7. Yeah, no shit. That's why they spread them out over two+ weeks, and reccomend checking with your doctor first. That still ENCOURAGES vaccination.

8. Again, outright false. Autism is a genetic disease, it's not something you can inject yourself with. And the study says children 3-5, you can't even diagnose children with autism at 3! And so many people are misdiagnosed because people feel rushed to ""cure"" a problem that isnt curable. Sure, you can make accommodations and try to help the person, but you cant cure genetics.

9. ""That doesn't make these studies any less legitimate."" These studies either weren't legitimate to begin with, or you took them out of context to say what they don't say. Furthermore when there are way more studies that show a different result than one theory-based article, that definitely suggests those sources are at best suspicious, and at worst outright wrong.

2. I'm not most antivaxxers, what about my post was misinterpreted?
3. Source needed
4. It's *more* likely that the system failed? Why? Because vaccinations cause so little harm? That's my point, there isn't enough research into the harm of vaccinations, so there's no data to derive the conclusion that it's *more* likely that the system failed. We won't know it until we actually do some research. Until then everything you and I say are expectations, not fact.
5. How do we know that the current covid vaccines don't share the same problem? There's a lot of talk of getting new booster shots every year. The pfizer CEO has already stated that he'd recommend a third dose. If you look at what the producers say, they'll say that they have no idea and want to wait until they have more long term data, so possibly the initial two shots are already too much too soon.
6. Yeah that's a common theme on both the pro and anti side. Like you just stated that it's more likely to be the cause of the system without checking if the vaccine is at fault. Conclusion, more research is needed.
7. Not really sure what exactly you're referring to here.
8. I just googled ""is autism genetic or environmental"" and I got an entire list of articles saying that it's mostly genetical, but can be environmental too.  
Another quick google for autism before 3yo leads me here [https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/signs.html](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/signs.html) and I quote ""ASD begins before the age of 3 years (...) Some children show ASD symptoms within the first 12 months of life.""
9. Sounds like you haven't actually read the studies and would rather conclude that I'm wrong. Can you not see the irony in you calling other people science deniers?  
I didn't post one article. I posted multiple studies.  
Suspicious or not, we're talking about the lives of billions of people here. Anything suspicious should be considered with utmost urgency. As for the fact that they're the minority, if we'd all listen to the majority the entire west would still be christian and crusading into the middle east.

Sydney’s hospital system is crumbling because of COVID 

Last time i needed to go to hospital for non life threatening treatment i was waiting for 4 hours to just see a doctor

My mother had to go to Westmead (basically Sydney’s biggest hospital)

12 HOURS to just see a doctor

2. 40%? Link please. The only ones vaccinated and going to hospital have either had one dose or are in poor health usually. These people would probably have died before vaccination existed as an option. It takes at least 3 weeks after your second dose of vaccine for your immune system to have reacted fully. Until then your response won't be as good.
3. WTF? Do you live in China? Once vaccinations reach 80% lockdowns will end. Look at UK now. Massive infection rate, minimal hospitalizations due to vaccinations. **Get vaccinated. We are getting exposed to Covid at some point.**
4. Wrong. Do you mean a normal immune response to a vaccine in healthy people.  This is temporary and shows your immune system is working and making anti-bodies to fight the virus should you get infected.  Serious adverse reactions are rare and much rarer than serious complications from Covid. Delta is now smashing kids.
5. Anecdotal. People are dying or getting seriously sick. Get vaccinated and protect people you care about if you are healthy.
6. Tuskegee was a disgrace. This is nothing like that. The Governments in Western Democracies have nothing to gain from mass illness and death.

False, covid-19 has no relation to the common cold, and no viral strain of the common cold has a transmission rate that is even remotely comparable to covid-19, it is one of the most infectious diseases in human history next to the black death.

Can you still get Covid-19 when vaccinated? Yes, but the chances are much lower and the severity of the virus will also be much less. The flu vaccine works exactly the same way.

The vaccine itself creates antibodies that target a protein found in COVID-19 if I’m not mistaken, and that protein is also in the variant. Therefore, the vaccine is effective against the variant, but due to the mutation that caused the delta variant, it is harder to fight off.

In the case of the original strain of COVID, the vaccine should work very well. In the case of delta variant, it still helps a lot and gives a much lower chance of becoming severely ill and a lower risk of death.

Honestly I find both sides to be reasonable with fears of taking it to prevent covid and trying to find the best one and not taking it due to insufficient data most of the people I know who taking it only had taken it because they feared they were going to lose their jobs and again I'm just putting that out there and they're also scared of what might happen in the future and fearing they won't be compensated should something happen and this might just be me sounding cynical but it just seems a lot of people are taking it not to prevent covid but so they can return to a more normal life and be able to travel and see people not everyone but it does seem to be the majority

""It doesn't add up""  
""I have a bad feeling about this""  
""It's suspicious""

But I never see an explanation what exactly you find sus.

The thing is that: of course you have a bad feeling about a global pandemic and the shitton of inconvenient lockdown regulations. Nobody feels comfortable with how things escalated. Living in a pandemic sucks. Everyone wants this situation to change.

But people seem to interpret this ""off"" feeling as ""it's off BECAUSE SOMEONE DID SOMETHING WRONG"" because our brain cannot comprehend things Just Happening, let's be real... Us humans are natural problemsolvers, but I see this backfiring when we ""oversolve"", connect dots that aren't even there, and that's how conspiracy theories are born.

Think about it, what adds up more:

1. The mainstream opinion on the pandemic, which, while do not explain everything, perfectly follow each other
2. ""I don't know why but something is wrong""

*We partially brought this upon ourselves with climate change and invasion of nature, making it easier for animal viruses to infect humans. It is unknown if there was laboratory negligence involved on China's side, but it seems even if that's the reason why it was unleashed, COVID-19 is caused by a virus of natural origin ie. even if it was from the lab, it was a sample collected from nature to be examined, not modified. Scientists had been saying it's about time for a pandemic, which is often cited as ""sus"" but by this logic, weather forecasts are sus. Pandemics emerge every 100 years or so and it was clear we are about to get there, even sooner than we think with climate change and deforestation. From there, it was easy peasy for COVID to spread much faster than a pandemic ever before in history, because we now travel a lot and spend a lot of time in crowds. Efforts to identify drugs that can be effective started right away (hydroxychloroquine, antivirals like remdesivir and favipiravir, ilvermectin, antibody treatments) and were in use ASAP when they proved even a little bit effective, but vaccination is still the best solution since it's obviously better to not have people who need these drugs at all. I don't know why this part always gets totally overlooked by antivaxxers, but pharma companies at first were all reluctant to start any vaccine development, since COVID didn't seem big enough that it will worth it. Only after it was clear that COVID would destroy our economy that pharma companies started funding vaccine research, and many researchers who already had promising new faster vaccine technologies in the works that were previously largely ignored (virus vector vaccines and especially mRNA vaccines) got support to develop one to completion. mRNA vaccines were already in human trials back in 2017 against cancer and HIV. Because all the vaccine build upon existing technologies and the mechanism of how vaccines work is one of the most straightforward out of all drugs (plus releasing a new vaccine in the span of months is not unheard of in general when we are talking about a new vaccine for a new variant of an existing disease eg. influenza), there were no reasons not to speed up development and shorten the trials to the minimum, while carefully tracking the population's reaction to it and changing recommendations during Phase IV in case of extremely rare effects, (that even normally would only emerge at this stage) emerge (as it happened with AstraZeneca for example... I mean come on, if they really wanted to secretly poison us, why would they let the blood clot cases end up in the news and subsequently change the recommendations to avoid this from happening again?)*

What is it about this story, that doesn't add up?

And now we are here again, having to create new lockdown regulations, and antivaxxers who caused this scream ""sus"" again. Immunization of the population should've happened much faster to prevent new variants from emerging, but because of vaccine hesitancy, we now have even vaccinated people end up in hospitals with delta, back at square one again. Those who pulled the ""long term side effects, I'll wait"" excuse will be pulling it again when a booster for the variant is released, saying ""it's a new vaccine, I'll have to wait"", repeating this cycle over and over again.

No one went to the hospital. Non of us had trouble breathing and half of us have asthma, arthritis, lupus, and more autoimmune disorders. I have a very low immune system and possibly a autoimmune disorder, asthma, and id been vaping for 3 years and no problems with my lungs. I will say it hit my parents a little harder but mostly headaches and body aches. 2 of my aunts work in a hospital and have seen no huge amounts of people being admitted. She said the ER is stating they are “over populated” in the hospitals because they are isolating people who are sick so they cant have 2 people in a room unless they are both sick with covid. So their space is limited so they say they are overcrowded. 

My boyfriends grandfather took his 2nd dose of the vaccine and dies 5 days later in the hospital. My cousin is 28 and took her first shot and developed myocarditis and refused her second shot due to side effects. My other family members who have gotten the vaccine have developed extreme fatigue, change in mental health like increased anxiety and intrusive thoughts. And some family members have actually told me they feel like completely different people. I love all of my family and have no problem if people get vaccinated or not. 

I am not antivax but i am hesitant to get it due to my autoimmune problems.

2 people had COVID, my boyfriend (late 20s) who was sick for a week with a fever and had body aches for another week, it wasn't much worse than a flu but it's the worst he experienced in his adult life. Another family member, who is overweight and has an autoimmune disease had it and was sick on and off for about 3 weeks but eventually recovered without complications, it was just annoying beause whenever he thought he's good, he fell back into feeling worse, and also suffered a complete loss of taste and smell for weeks.

Vaccine statistics:  
Grandparents (80s) got it back in december, not side effects. Parents, one a chainsmoker with high blood pressure, other immunocompromised, got it, no side effects. The family member who had COVID later got vaccinated with no side effect. His has a sibling who also has similar health issues got gallstones between the two doses but unrelated because they were big enough that it was clear they were present way before. Eventially also recieved the 2nd dose with no side effects.  
Boyfiend got both doses too, no side effects. I got both doses, no side effects either (late 20s female). I can sad 5 friends our age from the top of my head who got vaccinated without any side effect, 2 of which are mothers with small babies born very soon before they were vaccinated, one breastfeeding. Boyfriend's family: 2 people Pfizered, one had fever after the 2nd dose for a day. So far everyone I mentioned was Pfizer or Moderna. Another 2 family members, mid20s men, got Johnson, one of them had fever for a day after, the other had no side effects. The last person to be vaccinated was one of these people, back in July, so quite a long time passed since and no sign of any ""long term side effect"".

I did not count having a sore arm as a side effect, but if we count it, that's what everyone had. We all expected fatigue but couldn't tell if it was because we had to wake up early for our appointment.

The thing is that, stories like mine are the more common. I am yet to know a single person personally who can tell about something like you. And ""not feeling like the same people"" is not really a properly defined side effect - not us feel the same after 2 years of continuous pandemic stress. I had my lowest point way before I got vaccinated, so if all you see that in March 2020 I was happy but June 2021 I was a disaster, you could blame it on the shot that occured between the 2 dates but I can assure you it was rather the 1 whole year of apocalyptic atmosphere that preceded it.

The problem is: you guys are the ones mixing this up with politics. As a scientist, I feel the scientific community had been in constant fight with the governments, begging for more reasonable restrictions and vaccination requirements, so the way you interpret this being scientists hand-in-hand conspiring with governments to ruin people's lives is absolutely bizzare.

h9rmwq5,1629533639.0,Most_Acanthaceae_842,"So if people aren’t getting vaccinated, are they at least following the other options? If you’re working in a wood shop you wear gloves and goggles and ear protection. Welders wear welding hoods and leathers. Loggers wear corked boots, hard hats, and gloves. 

The virus can pass through masks, but in very small amounts. Masks are for droplet precautions. It’s called viral load. For instance most people can be exposed to a few HIV virus proteins, and not actually catch it. The viral load was small enough that immune response can defeat it. At my hospital, there are 45 needle sticks each year or so, most with exposures to Blood Borne Pathogens (BBP’s) like Hep C. In 26 years, nobody has ever converted an infection from an exposure. This is because staff wear gloves and they act as squeegees on the dirty needle but a hollow needle still has BBP contamination. The gloves don’t stop needle sticks and they don’t completely stop exposure to BBP’s. Minuscule amounts of BBP mind you. But staff still wear gloves. 

That said, Covid passes thousands of times easier than a BBP. The virus primarily infects via droplets from the mouth and nose of an infected person. What would you suggest people wear for PPE with covid if not masks?

For this reason, masks work when worn by everyone. That means you wear the mask to protect other people in case you’re asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. You also wear a mask to avoid droplet transmission from someone else. 

Last is hand washing and sanitizing. Hands are the biggest vector for disease on the human body. Washing hands and sanitizing is very important right now. 

So my question is, if you’re not vaccinating are you at least wearing a mask in public and washing your hands? 

What if you’re anti-mask? Do you at least wash your hands and cough in your arm?  

At what point do you do things that are unsafe so that you can claim your freedom? Loggers don’t throw their hard hats to claim their freedom just because head injuries are rare in logging. Food handlers don’t freak out over wearing gloves to make our food to keep their freedom. How is that any different than wearing a mask? At a minimum, wear a mask for selfish reasons to keep yourself alive.  

Covid is killing people. Democrats and Republicans and now more republicans than anyone else. Hospitals are overwhelmed. What if you need emergency medical attention and the hospital is packed and you’re left on an ER gurney on a hallway for 6-12 hours, which is happening to 40% of ER patients in the nation right now.

Severe side effects in as much as .2% of doses per CDC. Now go look up the odds of winning your local lottery. Don’t trust the CDC? Look up WHO stats. Or Canada’s health ministry.

It’s currently becoming more and more unfair to blame anti-vaxxers for the continued spread of covid as more and more studies are being released claiming that even vaccinated individuals are able to spread the disease.

So for these pro covid vaxers(who were fortunate to not have any side effects)to talk down on individuals who choose to take precaution when deciding to get vaccinated makes no sense to me. Getting vaccinated will not get rid of covid, hence people are still catching and spreading it being fully vaccinated. I know vaccinated family members and friends that have contracted it and even hospitalized. Yes it MAY save you from dying or being hospitalized. But that’s not 100% guaranteed, there have been reports of people being hospitalized or dying after the vaccine. Pro covid vaccine people need to realize these vaccines are still being experimented. I refuse to partake in this clinical trial/experiment. And that’s my choice. I see no wrong in people waiting till all the kinks are figured out before putting something in their bodies... that’s common sense. Everyone is fine now but who’s to say these vaccines won’t cause long term effects? No one knows cause this shit is still fucking new. In a few years if the people who are vaccinated are fine and have no long term effects..then I’ll consider taking it. And don’t come under my comment saying “dying is rare, being hospitalized is rare, spreading it is rare, catching it rare”🙄overall all those are still possible after vaccination I don’t care about percentages. Cause if this so called “99% immunity” that i keep seeing on here was true why do I keeping witnessing the people around me contracting the virus???

Get off the high horses and stop acting like being fully vaccinated is a religion or a gang. You want people to get vaccinated then stop causing division in people who are and aren’t.

I've watched and listened to left wing commentary from the powers to be and so called right wing conspiracist.
I've read articles and observed those who've received the vaccine and those who haven't. 

My wife received the Pfizer back in may. 

I don't take my health litely.

My drinks of preference are coffee, tea, and water. I steer away from soft drinks. I follow a low carb diet and do not indulge in sweets.
I excessive regularly.
I'm 6'0 200 with a low bmi.
I watch my cholesterol and blood pressure. 

I've been blown out of a two story building. I've been shot a couple of times. I've been knived and stabbed. I've been in auto accidents and motorcycle accidents.
I've had a broken lower back L1-S5. I've had 8 broken ribs.
I have had a traumatic brain injury causing physical brain damage, memory loss, and ADHD.

After looking into past vaccines as well, negative side effects show up *at the latest* 8 weeks. Obviously, as the quote says the covid vaccines show their negative side effects within 6 weeks.

6 weeks ago was July 8th. By that date 158 million Americans had been fully vaccinated and should all have had their negative effects by now. Even with that many people vaccinated, the number of deaths these vaccines have caused are far below a fraction of a percent.

It gets developed,  it's injected to the body and hoping the body's immune system is able to figure out what the hell to do with it. Body has to be first of all defeat the weak sample and the body will learn okay that's how you get rid of it and it's able to come up with the antibodies and the memory cells so if covid or influenza or chicken pox I can't remember the medical name for it. Comes knocking into the body again the body will go oh I know this thing and it's able to throw antibodies on it before it has a chance to incubate and infects anything further. That's the theory of what the body is expected to do.  Will it work 100% kind of depends everybody is different it might work for the majority but you know some people have a immune system suppression medication their immune system might be compromised. There's a lot of variables yes for the majority it would work. Suffering chronic disease, disorders, it's more of a doctor to take everything about you and your immune function the type of food you eat etc. To able to determine how well your body will be able to respond to the vaccine. I'm not anti-vax I'm not provax, I myself think it's probably a lot better to go outside with some degree of protection no matter how little it is to then just to jump into wild and have the body deal with the virus first time ever with no clue how to deal with it.

The vaccine is experimental and has no long term data to prove it's safety or effectiveness regardless of FDA approval. FDA has recalled more drugs lately than they have approved due to negative effects. If I were to get COVID-19 I would much rather take my chances with my own natural immune system. It's gotten me this far and I would likely be in much better shape moving forward with long term natural immunity.

Natural Immunity Offers Far Superior Protection
Bridle also explains why natural immunity offers robust protection against all variants, whereas vaccine-induced immunity can’t. When you acquire the infection naturally, your body develops antibodies against ALL of the viral proteins whereas the COVID shots only trigger antibodies against one, namely the spike protein.

As mentioned above, when you have antibodies against just one of the viral proteins, the virus only needs to mutate that one protein in order to evade your immune system. When you have natural immunity, on the other hand, your antibodies will recognize all parts of the virus, so even if the spike protein is mutated, your body will recognize other parts of the virus and mount an attack against those.

That SARS-CoV-2 works the same way other viruses do was shown in a Nature Reviews Immunology study7 by Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty, published in October 2020. The study, “Cross-Reactive Memory T Cells and Herd Immunity to SARS-CoV-2” argued that naturally-acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is potent, long-lasting and very broad in scope, as you develop both antibodies and T cells that target multiple components of the virus and not just one.

If we are to depend on vaccine-induced immunity, as public health officials are urging us to do, we’ll end up on a never-ending booster treadmill. Boosters will absolutely be necessary, as the shot offers such narrow protection against a single protein of the virus. Already, data around the world show vaccine-induced protection is waning rapidly in the face of new variants, and Moderna has publicly stated that the need for additional boosters is expected.

h9890tw,1629160288.0,Rick91981,">potential long term risks that come with those new vaccines. Especially the mRNA ones


They have been studying mRNA vaccines for decades and are quite familiar with how it works but the reason there haven't been long term human trials is because until recently, the mRNA was breaking down too fast for the body to even acknowledge it. In recent years, they discovered the correct lipids(aka fat) to coat it in so it breaks down slower.

How about 4 years though? That's pretty long term. Plenty long enough for any so called ""long term side effects"" to show up. Moderna has a CMV vaccine in human trials since 2017.

That's a difficult point, but there have always been children under 18 that take medical advice from their parents, their signature is required. I still don't see why that point is so contentious with covid.

People with compromised immune system are at risk of pretty much everything and the anti vaxxers (as well as scientists) have predicted that covid will keep mutating, possibly requiring a new vaccine every season.

The United States specifically has more vaccines than we know what to do with and if you walk into any CVS or Walgreens you are more than likely going to get it, no questions asked. Most places in the United States or at least the major metro areas are offering ways for folks to either get the vaccine at home or provide transportation for those without cars or a safe way to walk to CVS too.

You have an extremely low chance of dying from the vaccine too. The end result are folks flooding the hospitals from a preventable illness and overworking medical staff because you didn't want to take an hour out of your day to get vaccinated. Here's the people you are hurting because of your selfishness;

* Yourself because very few people want to go to a hospital and possibly die
* The doctors and other hospital staff who are getting increasingly overworked
* People who need to go to the hospital for everyday injuries and conditions like accidents and other emergencies that aren't related to COVID or other illnesses
* People who are unable to get vaccinated for legit reasons but otherwise would because no one wants to catch an illness
* The families and friends of those who've died of COVID
* People who have been quarantined since the start of this pandemic and have suffered poor mental health as a result

I've decided that anti-vaxxers aren't stupid, because even stupid people can have things explained to them and change their behavior.

Anti-vaxxers are selfish.

h96a1pg,1629131135.0,donaldbergman,"I understand your point of being selfish. I believe that we are all selfish but for different reasons. However, if we take a look at your argument that unvaccinated people have the potential risk of being spreaders and a host for a possible mutation. Where you also claim that if these people are vaccinated that wouldn’t be an issue. 

I would totally agree with you if didn’t bring other countries into the context. Based upon WHO latest  reports, many developing countries still struggle with vaccinations. WHO has also published warnings where they are worried about that rich countries, developed countries, buys too much vaccine to vaccinate people who aren’t really a risk group. Where old and sick people in more unfortunate countries still gets hospitalized despite this obvious solution. 

So, if we get back to your argument. According to your own logic, wouldn’t this lack of vaccine in other countries also lead to mutations and more spread? If so, It really doesn’t matter if people get vaccinated where you live because it would still occur mutations in other parts of the world, which would spread, probably as fast as Covid-19. So, if we pretend that what I say is true, wouldn’t the first and top priority be to vaccinate all people around the world who are in risk groups?

I believe in critical thinking and discussion. I don’t like putting people into groups and just disclaim them as something like “selfish”.

So if you're worried that I'm going to be taking up hospital resources, that's probably not going to happen.

As for the possibility of further spreading the disease, sure I could do that. I mean, anyone can really. Considering I barely get ill, I think you would be better of getting pissed at people with HIV, I actually have a functioning immune system.

That's a bit of a leap. Imagine a vaccinated person who spends his time drinking, fighting and eating nothing but McDonalds and some unvaccinated person who spends his time working out and eating healthy, but he doesn't want a vaccination out of fear of needles. Is the second guy really less deserving of care? Who gets to determine the ""deservingness of care"" anyway? If it's the government then it reminds me a lot of china's social point system, which I and a lot of people in the west find rather draconian. If it's the hospital then I'm fine with it, but that will inevitably lead to doctors who will help anyone in need of help, which honestly is how I think doctors should behave.

So then I guess the argument is that vaxxers don't like anti vaxxers, out of fear that they or someone they love may not get a place in a hospital when they need it?

Theres a slim chance you might experience a few cold/flu like symptoms for a day or two at most after taking the vaccines. I personally had a perpetual headache during that period. For a scant few in the statistical data, they might have more severe complications. But, this is also why your local clinic insists you hang around for a minimum of 15 minutes after vaccination before going about your business. That way in the off chance severe complications do occur, medical staff will have been ready and waiting to lend you a hand.

For the large majority of people out there however, this is a complete non-issue. I forget the exact statistical data for severe complications, but it was something to the tune of about 1 in 1000 or some large number in that general ballpark. But thats about the long and short of it all Billy.

h8zng1r,1628997762.0,ShokkShield,"Wow, a lot to unpack here, but the TL,DR is that this person is INCREDIBLY wrong. 


Claim 1. You will permanently alter your immune system: 

Misleading. The difference here is that you’ll introduce Antibodies which weren’t there before. None of your “core machinery” will stop working or function differently. Production of antibodies to more effectively mount an immune response (defending the body) is what your immune system does anyways- you’re just giving it another weapon in the armory. 

Claim 2: it’s outdated and does nothing against the delta variant.

Greater than 99% of people that die from COVID are unvaccinated. This is a straight up lie.
 

Claim 3: you’ll have to take boosters the rest of your life, every 6-12 months. 

This hasn’t been studied, although it’s currently in the process. But if it’s true, we already do this with multiple vaccines. You have to re-apply sunscreen, that doesn’t make it dangerous.


Claim 4: you are more likely to spread the virus than the unvaccinated.


Yeah this is a lie. The vaccine reduces your chance of transmission.

Claim 5: only time will tell, you’ll be an ‘Animal’ in the trials.

This technology has been developed over the course of 30+ years. Vaccines in general have been around longer. There are potential side effects of the vaccine, however these side effects are ALL present in people WITH COVID, and they’re less dangerous and more rare in the vaccinated. Example: blood clots. present in the J&J vaccine, which is a more traditional vaccine. Vaccine blood clots are extremely rare <1%. 20% of ICU patients develop Blood clots due to COVID.",p4ealb,h8yitrg,That_Soft28,2

h95todg,1629124594.0,That_Soft28,"Natural Immunity Offers Far Superior Protection
Bridle also explains why natural immunity offers robust protection against all variants, whereas vaccine-induced immunity can’t. When you acquire the infection naturally, your body develops antibodies against ALL of the viral proteins whereas the COVID shots only trigger antibodies against one, namely the spike protein.

As mentioned above, when you have antibodies against just one of the viral proteins, the virus only needs to mutate that one protein in order to evade your immune system. When you have natural immunity, on the other hand, your antibodies will recognize all parts of the virus, so even if the spike protein is mutated, your body will recognize other parts of the virus and mount an attack against those.

That SARS-CoV-2 works the same way other viruses do was shown in a Nature Reviews Immunology study7 by Alessandro Sette and Shane Crotty, published in October 2020. The study, “Cross-Reactive Memory T Cells and Herd Immunity to SARS-CoV-2” argued that naturally-acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is potent, long-lasting and very broad in scope, as you develop both antibodies and T cells that target multiple components of the virus and not just one.

If we are to depend on vaccine-induced immunity, as public health officials are urging us to do, we’ll end up on a never-ending booster treadmill. Boosters will absolutely be necessary, as the shot offers such narrow protection against a single protein of the virus. Already, data around the world show vaccine-induced protection is waning rapidly in the face of new variants, and Moderna has publicly stated that the need for additional boosters is expected.",p4ealb,h8yitrg,That_Soft28,2

You should recognize that if everyone was vaccinated, there’d be a dramatic decrease in variations. Additionally, the mutation must occur in the spike protein encoded by the antibodies. 

So you’re right. You ONLY need a SPECIFIC, BENEFICIAL mutation at a SPECIFIC location on the COVID DNA and you need to come into CONTACT with it.

hap7cii,1630168992.0,WallstreetBytes,"TL;DR The Vaccine doesn’t stop or slow the spread. It helps those with preexisting conditions survive, which is great. Government mandating everyone to be vaccinated is a test to see if the sheeple give in and follow government. If they do, the government will continue to grow more tyrannical. Giving up your freedom for the false sense of security is asinine. If that’s you, you don’t deserve to be free, but caged.

I had Covid 19 last year, as well as my family. My dad was almost put on a ventilator, but thankfully we all recovered. Now, I think it’s asinine to get the vaccine after one has already been sick. After getting the flu, do you get the flu shot? The whole premise of getting the vaccine is stopping/slowing the spread. However, It doesn’t STOP or slow down the spread. Instead, it helps the vaccinated have a higher survival rate, which is great for the elderly and those with preexisting conditions. Moreover, if you think a vaccinated world is a step to going back to normal, you’re not only wrong but delusional. In the past, many viruses have plagued the earth, but this is the first one that has been instrumental in government controlling people’s lives. The Spanish flu from 1918-1920 had a death toll of 500 million people world wide, hardly any government control. From 2020-2021 Aug 28, Corona Virus killed 4.5 million. Don’t even think about giving credit to the government for locking us down, people are  still gathering! And the death tool isn’t anywhere near the Spanish flu. Yes, there are variables as to why that is medical advances, scientific break throughs, holistic knowledge, drugs, vaccines, etc. but then why the hysteria? Why the mandate, why the antivaxx vs. Vaxxers, left vs. right, etc. A: The fearful and divided are easily manipulated and controlled.",p42f4k,p42f4k,Most_Acanthaceae_842,1

h8r9ixd,1628838535.0,HorniPolice07,"Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world are simultaneously shaking their heads and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.


Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as ""Grammar Nazis"") from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.


That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make:


*FUCKING MORONS*.",p301l1,p301l1,grimmripper5120,1
h8rnhdp,1628850247.0,MMDDYYYY_is_format,"Sorry English is not my native language  
  
Pardon for my inexcusably poor understanding of the Anglo-Frisian-Germanic language, and thus regional dialects, known by native speakers as ""English"". Indeed I do give my upmost effort to educate myself and better my understanding and thus comprehension of such an unusual yet widely used modern foreign language, but alas my efforts have so far encountered nothing but limited success. The combinations of both Latin and Germanic lexis have so far proved to be a serious tribulation for my progress.  
  
​

Before we continue, it is of upmost importance that I state my location of residence as to clarify why my linguistic skills are so substandard. I reside in the sovereign state recognised by the United Nations, and thus the international diplomatic sphere, as ""The French Republic"", colloquially our title is simplified to just ""France"" for ease of use purposes. Now you may be considering the stereotype that us Frenchmen are reluctant to undertake the studying of languages, and indeed you are in fact correct, the opposite is true of our neighbours to the North East of Alsace and Lorraine, called Germans.  
  
​

Now you are probably considering the, lets face it, obvious possibility that English isn't my first Language. This is also a correct statement, quite predictably, my mother tongue is infact in ""French"" language, though I can also competently converse in the languages known in the Anglo sphere as: ""German"", ""Mandarin"", ""Korean"", ""Latin"", ""Old Norse"", ""Hanajii"" and ""Proto-Luganian Celtic"" The latter of which I take great pride in understanding.  
  
​

However, I do not share such linguistic capabilities and expansive lexicon in my understanding of ""English"", so therefore I must once again profusely apologise for my such poor use of the vocabulary, Grammar and other such linguistic factors that one must consider in this context.

We also realise that covid is the battle at hand, and that winning battles is one way to win the war (if such a thing is possible). To deny that covid is real is to willingly choose to lose the battle that we are presented with. Then the government has more chance of winning the war (that they wage in the name of greed, control and power) with harsher lockdowns and restrictions.",p2t0ez,h8mcs3g,VeganExcellency,2

However I am a very healthy individual as far as immune system what I consume and exercise daily.

 I wear a mask in public at all times and have since they started suggesting it in March or April of 2020. I am also choosing not to be Vaxxed 

So as a society in 2020 we have respected what people want to do with their bodies more than ever. So what are we doing here guys and girls when we are now insulting people or thinking lesser of someone for not wanting to put something in their bodies! 

I also think if you want to be Vaxxed and it makes you feel safe for you and your family then do it!! 

Fact: There is a virus called Covid 19
Fact: The Vaccine does lessen your chance of getting it and can make you less sick if you do get it
Fact: Masks do help
Fact: Anti bodies naturally happen when recovering from the virus 
Fact: The're medications out there that if you take while having contracted covid it will lessen your symptoms 

Theory: The Covid vaccine lessens in potency the longer it's in your system so hope y'all are ready for your yearly covid booster 
Theory: Anti bodies work just as well as the vaccine if not better 
Theory: We don't know long term effects this Vaccine or Virus is going to have on people anyone that tells you differently I highly doubt is a doctor and probably not a wizard either! 
Theory: We already saw what potentially happened to a percentage that took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. And the blood clots they caused 

I broke it up in fact and theory because I will not debate facts but I will debate theory!
