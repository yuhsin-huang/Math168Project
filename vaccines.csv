hb5ufui,1630482393.0,SportsTherapy,I hope someone more knowledgeable and understanding is able to answer your question but my main take away from reading this would be as follows. The negative side effects of these older vaccines are extremely rare and even the article admits that aluminum absorption rates aren't well studied. Side effects of this diseases they help prevent are. More suffering is prevented by vaccinations than the suffering they cause IMO. that being said hopefully with the success of MRNA vaccines I hope they can positively impact how we deliver vaccines.

You both get to a halfway clean enviorment and avoid airflow. Then you clean your hands your friend too obviosly with ideally alcohol. Heres where it is the trickiest now. You put your thumb next to your index finger and slightly push against it, so that the skin pushes a bit upwards. Your trusted friend now grabs that piece of skin (like hes pinching it with the tip of his index and thumb, but not with the nails you need a good grip) then move it around if he or you feel something between the pinched skin because the you pulled something up important by moving you can kinda release it from your pinch without loosing the grip of the pinch. You should be left with the pinched skin about the fat layer. The fat layer is where the chip goes. Now your not squeemish friend jabs the needle parallel to your indexfinger bone. Account for the position of the chip you want it between the index finger and thumb realitvely in the middle look at my pics the entry is infront of the actuall chip because of the needle length. There will be more resistence than you expect going through the skin be prepared to keep the needle straight you might damage something after you go through the skin its gonna be way easier to move around. Then its like a normal needle push the chip in pull the needle out. Theres gonna be alot of blood for like 2 minutes. And then its just taking care of the entry wound.

I, on the other hand, was totally fine after my first but felt extremely tired and had a fever after my second. Both of our reactions were totally normal and anticipated, but worth noting that each family member could experience slightly different things.

In short, the mRNA is delivered to your cells and transported to the ribosome. If the mRNA is a template, then the ribosome can be thought of as a mold that holds the mRNA template and allows the translation of the mRNA template into the protein.

This ribosome is much like a computer, or maybe a 3D-printer, that reads the mRNA, so the mRNA itself has instructions for the ribosome. An important instruction is where the translation should start, this is called a start codon. At the end of the mRNA sequence for the spike, there is an area where they use so called stop codons. Pfizer repeats the same stop codon twice, Moderna uses all three possible stop codons in a row. This is how the translation stops.

Of course, there is the question of what is stopping the ribosome from just repeating this process? The answer is, enzymes that exist to degrade the mRNA. They are called ribonucleases (or RNase for short) and their function is to cut mRNA into smaller bits. This takes some time of course, but in a few days, the RNase will have degraded all mRNA from the vaccines.

This paper is a critical appraisal of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA strategies: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310186/

I'm just messing around.  I got J&J in March and had an uncomfortable night's sleep, but no specific reason why. Could have been hypochondria. Sore arm for a couple of days. 

I got a Pfizer backup (before the cool kids were doing it) a few weeks ago. Sore arm (is that really a side effect?) and the next morning slight headache (not very unusual for me) and it felt like vax fog. It was a little hard to concentrate. 2 advil and an hour later I was fine. Then that night I MIGHT have had a low grade fever, but I didn't bother with a thermometer even. 2 advil again sorted it out.

That was it.

It's not even clear what you mean by spread of the virus.
Is it only the ability of someone who has a breakthrough infection to infect someone else? Or, is it the ability of the virus to first infect a person, replicate until enough virus is made and then infect someone?

The two scenarios are distinct. Both are quite difficult to study in the context of a clinical trial. If someone in a trial infects someone else, that person is most likely not part of the trial. Another problem is time. How long do you need to follow your subjects, and anyone they are in contact with, to be able to assess transmission? Yet another problem is that during the vaccine trials, all kinds of measures were taken to prevent the spread of the virus.

hap6lcy,1630168666.0,freckled_morgan,"One reason: capacity.

To test this during a clinical trial, especially with a novel pathogen, they would need access to a LOT of testing—people getting tested at least weekly, if not more, regardless of symptoms—and this was before at-home tests were approved. Having people come in to the clinic for weekly testing could have posed more of a risk and would have required more staff and more materials which, especially last summer, were difficult to access even for those acutely ill or exposed (staff, PPE for staff, test kits, transport to labs, lab capacity, etc.) People may have been less willing to sign up if they needed to get an NP PCR test that often too.

You’d also want to have a really strong contact tracing network for those that tested positive. Contact tracing in the US has mostly been an absolute disaster, so this either would have required setting up another contact tracing team in cities where they held trials (except that team would not have had any legal authority) or relied on the states, which were already struggling to keep up. Again, capacity. 

I would disagree with largely unknown here too.

More evidence is needed to determine exactly how well they stop infection and transmission.”

WHO is also against vaccines mandates for this and many other reasons, a big one is global equity.  

WHO is the most reliable source, they have not government affiliation and they are a non-profit organizations.  All other information is skewed by media, politics and money.  Also much of the information regarding vaccine efficacy and transmission are “estimates”.

Has there ever been a vaccine in the history of the world that had side effects only show up several months or years after receiving it?

No, that has never happened. This is a methodological paper on the risk window after vaccination. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18312350#b0180

The purpose of this paper is to think about how to optimize this risk window for a specific class of vaccines, live vector vaccines (some of which can replicate after being administered), which are a special group of vaccines that will be used for very severe and difficult to vaccinate against diseases such as hiv. They mention a study and in that study (their reference 36) an evidence based window of 42 days is given and that 42 days is then compared to the next 42 days.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12010262?via%3Dihub

Those 42 days don't fall from a tree. They really are based on the plausibility of anything happening in a certain time frame.

Most cases of mononucleosis are caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you're infected with EBV, you carry the virus — usually in a dormant state — for the rest of your life. Sometimes, however, the virus may reactivate. When this happens, you're not likely to become ill. Rarely, reactivated EBV may cause illness in people who have weak immune systems, such as those who have AIDS.

Mononucleosis rarely leads to a serious condition called chronic EBV infection. In chronic EBV infection, you have long-lasting symptoms and a viral infection that lasts longer than usual after your original mononucleosis diagnosis.

https://teensforvaccines.org/how-to-talk-to-parents/

- Is there anyone in your family (or extended family) or her friends she trusts and who are provax for the COVID vaccine? Sometimes adults are only willing to hear it from other adults (like a friend’s mom talking to her). 

- If she is saying that it’s poison etc., it is a strong indication that she is buying into all the disinformation out there. Are you able to find a happy time with her that she sees you emotional about not getting the vaccine and how you are sad about not being able to do things you want to? Don’t mix this convo with facts, studies, etc., to prove anything. Just a heart-to-heart chat about how you feel. And see where that goes. She wants the best for you in the way she knows best (even if she is misguided), so just make sure you resonate to that emotion that she cares for you and you are sad (don’t weave in the angry, frustrated part). She may open up either right away or it will give her something to think about. And in a couple days, you can suggest perhaps both of you can go to the doctor and just speak to doctor. We have seen that sometimes parents don’t want to keep hearing facts and studies…a more emotional, gentle persistence works better. 

- Does she know about healthy young teens catching severe long-haul COVID and many dying? This whole “teens are a low risk” is not true especially with the highly contagious delta variant. One teen we helped shared examples with her mom (who was a bit more open to listen) and it helped. These examples and more tips are in the link above. 

DM me or use the link above to reach out for more help. Again, don’t lose heart. It is a process…to sometimes to get through…Hang in there! Super proud of you for trying!

Do you really want to catch footballs that come with a side order of infectious virus?  I don't.  That is substantially more likely to happen if your QB is unvaccinated.

ha5u07c,1629813251.0,freckled_morgan,"1) With natural infection, you are risking death and long-term disability due to COVID. That is not a risk with the vaccines. While the vaccines have been associated with a few serious reactions, the rates of these (and the rates of full recoveries from these) demonstrate that there is much less risk associated with the vaccine.   


The concept of ""natural"" immunity also makes a lot of assumptions that don't necessarily hold up. Reinfection is not extremely common, but it certainly seems to be becoming more common with Delta, which isn't extremely surprising; natural immunity to coronaviruses has not previously been thought to be as robust as ""natural"" immunity to, say, measles (vaccine is still better.)   


[This article](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm) demonstrates that reinfection occurred less often in those who were vaccinated after their first infection than those who were not vaccinated after their first infection.   


2) ADE is very complicated and occurs with a few viruses. This is not my specific area of expertise, but a lot of it has to do with the way the virus interacts with macrophages, which has not been seen in COVID. You can read more on that [here](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/222/12/1946/5891764). Epidemiologically (this is my thing), we also would have seen this by now in data on illness severity and hospitalizations. While occasional breakthrough cases are severe and some have resulted in deaths, the vast, vast majority of breakthrough cases are mild. 95% of hospitalizations (as a general estimate) have been in unvaccinated people, suggesting ADE is not at play.",pam3rv,pam3rv,johnnyvlad,1,vaccines

The first is very new, hasn't been peer reviewed yet and it is published on biorxiv. But, interesting nonetheless.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.12.443888v2.full

This group didn't focus on antibodies but on two types of T cells, the cd4+ (helper t cells) and cd8+ (cytotoxic 't cells). Both are needed for a robust immune response to supplement the antibody response which is mediated through B cells. Read about them here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell

In the study I linked looked at the T cell response. It has been observed that not only are antibodies waning, the available antibodies also become less effective against new variants. It has also been observed that at least some instances, a t cell response is elicited. This paper asks the question if having had covid-19 differs from vaccination. And, it does. Both induced a t cell response and in both cases the T cells recognize variants. An interesting finding was that in double vaccinated people the T cells are longer lived than in convalescent patients, but if you have only one shot the cd8+ T cells aren't even detectable.

The second study I want to touch upon is this one in Nature. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24435-8

In short, if you test antibody efficacy from either convalescent plasma or from vaccinated plasma, the vaccine antibodies are more focused to the receptor binding domain but to a wider range of the RBD making them more effective against mutations in the RBD.

For me, there are arguments to take the vaccine rather than (only) having had covid-19 that go beyond the possibility of severe illness.",pam3rv,pam3rv,johnnyvlad,1,vaccines

Their answers, knowledge of specifics, and training prepare them to keep you and you family safe. They are used to questions and discussions like this and will have the experience and expertise to answer your questions in the best way possible.  It is also important to remember that if you and your current PCP don't get along, you can always request a new one. 

The thing that I always suggest to people when this topic comes up is to make the attempt to dive into some reputable statistics. This is because of how important it is to remember the time before vaccines. The preventable childhood diseases that vaccines protect against were incredibly common and life threatening. Many childhood diseases, such as measles, still exist and come with a likelihood death or serious comorbidities. On the other hand, any stories you have heard about children dying or having an adverse reaction to the vaccine are often discussing exceedingly rare cases or are unreliable. In the situations that children have experienced a reaction or death, there was usually an underlying cause that has informed modern protocols. This is why it is important to speak with your child's doctor. If your child is immunocompromised, it is likely that they will not recommended your child receives certain vaccines. 

The bottom line is that the vaccines are much safer than your child contracting a preventable disease. Vaccine development and implementation has been extensively researched and revised since their inception, and prior to their existence we simply had to live in fear.

I know the anti vaccine narrative is deep and it is scary--but by and large, it is also not backed up by any reputable science at all. The ""studies"" that have been done are all very poorly done and most have been first published in pay-to-play journals--and then retracted. However, these various scary associations have all been studied--and in fact, are constantly being monitored. You brought up babies dying after vaccines, perhaps of SIDS? This is a common anti vaccine talking point with no support. Vaccinated children are actually at \*less\* of a risk of SIDS (likely not to do with the vaccines, but perhaps because of more access to regular care, where a provider may speak more about safe sleep.) There is no correlation with SIDS and date of vaccines or specific vaccines. The SIDS rate has absolutely plummeted in the US since the Back to Sleep campaign started in the early 1990s--as both the rate of kids vaccinated has gone up and a couple of new vaccines were added to the infant schedule. 

I'm really glad you're thinking about getting your kiddo caught up. I want to share a few really helpful links from some excellent sources. 

[CHOP](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccines-and-other-conditions/vaccines-sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids) is the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. They have a vaccine education center and pages, fully cited, on all manner of questions and myths about vaccines. I've linked their article about SIDS but there are dozens more. 

No, the diseases we vaccinate against aren't very prevalent anymore in countries with high vaccine uptake--because of vaccines. Children who aren't vaccinated, however, are FAR more likely to get these illnesses--and no, high dose vitamin C won't do a thing, besides create very expensive pee and possibly add diarrhea to the list of problems. Measles results in hospitalization in 10-20% of kids, even in high income countries.",p9sc87,p9sc87,throwawayanon3479,1,vaccines

In short, he was a quack and lied about it.

Of course, the truth came out but it took until 2011 to get the paper retracted, even though already in 2006 a journalist had raised serious questions. In the meantime, several large observational studies have been carried out to see if the observations that Wakefield made were present but they were not.

This was in March and I expect CHMP to reach a conclusion sometime this year. Unless the phase 3 trial shows something major and unexpected, I actually do believe it will be approved in Europe, because outside of the EU, it is used quite often and most countries will require proof of vaccination with an EMA approved vaccine. If the EU doesn't approve Sputnik, many people people will be pretty much banned from coming to the European Union unless they get tested. This is just my opinion. Doesn't mean the EU will deploy Sputnik at some point, it'll just be to allow people to travel in Europe. Also, Hungary uses Sputnik on an emergency clause. 

When it comes to adverse events, I really can't speak to the quality of reporting in the countries that use Sputnik but if they do their job well enough then I'm not hearing anything major.

1. you take the vaccine now and months or years later something happens because of the vaccine or,
2. you take the vaccine now, something happens in a couple of hours or days but it lasts for years.

The first one is what most people think about and usually people refer to drugs (for example thalidomide) to infer that something bad may happen. However, vaccines are not drugs. In the case of almost all covid vaccines, you get two shots and that's it (at least until a booster is needed but that is months later). However, the vaccines themselves do not last in your body. All vaccines are degraded rapidly by the body after they deliver their payload (vector and mRNA vaccines) and the spike protein itself is the subject of attack after the cells begin to create them, because the immune system is not fond of foreign proteins. After 6-8 weeks, it's all gone.

the second one does happen. For example the immunity you get from the vaccines stays for months if not years. At the moment, I'm not aware of adverse events having a long term effect (if treated properly).

What is classical about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? Perhaps you can elaborate on what you consider classical?

>Do we know how far above the background rate the side effects are yet?
Do we know what's causing the pericarditis and myocarditis yet?
Do we know how the numbers compare to vaccines of the past that we've all already gotten?

Background rate of what? This is really a very broad thing. Are you looking for the background rate of individual adverse events compared to the occurrence of that event after vaccination? For example, the normal rate of a sore arm is so many per thousand and with the vaccine it is so many per thousand? And that for each possible event? Or are you looking for something else?

The exact cause of the myocarditis and pericarditis is not known. It is known that viral infections can cause it and it is known to occur with certain drugs. How the vaccine could cause it is unknown but if I'd have to guess, I'd look into the immune response following the second shot. But that is a guess.

How the numbers compare to the other vaccines is more difficult to answer. If you look at all the events as absolute numbers then you see a very high number. However, at the same time hundreds of millions of people have been vaccinated in a very short time so you really need to know how many people have been vaccinated in the past and work out the numbers.

>
I am finding it surprisingly hard to compile these numbers because the data changes for each variant. Looking for raw numbers, not percentages relative to each other/other data points.

How are the raw numbers going to be helpful? Like I said, hundreds of millions of people have been vaccinated in little more than half a year in the US alone. If you don't relate the numbers to the number of people vaccinated and to the normal occurrence of certain events, what would the data tell you?

In any case, VAERS is an open database where you can find reports of events that have occurred after vaccination. It doesn't tell you if there is a causal relationship between the vaccine and the event, doesn't tell you how common the event is in the general population or any other information that you would need to interpret the data, but it is available.

Yeah, I'm looking for per capita data for comparison. Absolutes and percentages are both not as useful as per capita rates.

I've taken some looks through VAERS, but mostly just as compilations by other people. I grabbed the entire dataset just now, and I'll spend some time running my own queries against it to see if the dataset satisfies my questions. However, it seems the data is only so fine past a certain time period, and data sets only go back to 1990 which means it is really only useful for COVID information, and not previous campaigns.  (Also, when people make charts like [this](https://myvalleynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06-18-21-OP-Reeder-Graph.jpg) that are technically accurate, it looks scary and certainly doesn't help.)

As far as background rate, I'm referring to both within the general population and against previous vaccine campaigns, the latter being the important bit. I know that things like GBS have a background rate of 1-2/100k, but is the COVID vaccine ""special"" in any regard when it comes to specific side effects? I fear issues with the heart and potential other side effects, due to it being mRNA (which I have been reading about and looking forward to for years now).

>For example, the normal rate of a sore arm is so many per thousand and with the vaccine it is so many per thousand? And that for each possible event? Or are you looking for something else?

Yes, basically. I'm curious if the COVID vaccine(s) falls above that rate in any respect, and if it does, how does it compare against vaccines in the past?

If I have justified my risk of taking flu boosters in the past, and the COVID vaccine is indeed ""as dangerous"", then I either need to readjust my risk tolerance and take neither (I'll be honest - they are both more dangerous than I initially assumed), or accept that it is within my limits and take both.",p8l9hi,h9rugef,komodo2010,2,vaccines

There is no live virus that could potentially mutate or go dormant in your cells. There isn't a mechanism by which the genetic material could be reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome. 

If the vaccine were to generate self-reactive antibodies, the effects of that would show up within weeks of the dose.

Keep this in mind. https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/uog.23729

A few things stand out to me. Only a third of pregnant women who were eligible actually took the vaccine, so there is a lot oc hesitancy there. Secondly, the babies in both groups were fine, there was no difference between the babies in the vaccine vs no vaccine group. That's good news.

In this third study that I came across, they looked at spontaneous abortions. Now, on average these women were not as far along in their pregnancy as you are but close enough.

Here's why governments are paying for it: it is *much more expensive* for the government to pay for COVID hospitalizations than it is to buy vaccines. No matter what country you live in, the cost of COVID care is extremely high-- it requires specialized and expensive equipment, expensive medications, and a lot of care from specialized doctors and nurses. It is in the best interest of the government and insurance companies to keep people from being hospitalized. It is much cheaper for them to vaccinate people.

Even further, there's the cost of people getting sick. Sick people can't work. Sick people get other people sick. Those people can't work.

Herd immunity can be reached when enough people have been vaccinated against a disease and have developed protective antibodies against future infection.

Using the concept of herd immunity, vaccines have successfully controlled contagious diseases such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, rubella and many others.

Herd immunity makes it possible to protect the population from a disease, including those who can't be vaccinated, such as newborns or those who have compromised immune systems.

But reaching herd immunity through vaccination against COVID-19 might be difficult because of issues such as
vaccine hesitancy. Some people may object to getting a COVID-19 vaccine because of religious objections, fears about the possible risks or skepticism about the benefits.

The second dose wasn't added to the [US CDC children's schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html#note-mmr) until after the 1989-1991 measles epidemic that while 1 dose of the vaccine was fairly effective against Measles(~90%) that it still wasn't enough to prevent large outbreaks.

I did get titer tests before I got the additional MMR dose more out of personal curiosity than anything else.  The test showed I was still immune to Measles and Rubella but not Mumps.  My experience isn't very rare.  There have been [several Mumps outbreaks](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/idweek/68405) that had a large percentage of college students that one or more MMR shots.  The Mumps component isn't quite as durable as the Measles component of the MMR vaccine.

It is not unusual for some women that are looking to get pregnant to an additional MMR shot if titer tests show they have little or no antibodies against Rubella.  Rubella can frequently cause birth defects so it is a regular part of prenatal testing.  The MMR vaccine is contraindicated for pregnant women because it is a live vaccine.

Some people applying for nursing or medical school will also need a MMR booster shots as well.  Sometime that is because vaccination records got lost as they moved.

h8suj56,1628872842.0,_Rushdog_1234,"The astrazeneca vaccine has been associated with a  blood clotting condition called vaccine induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis  (VITT) which can lead to blood clots depositing in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) as well as other parts of the body such as the lungs (Pulmonary embolism). CVST induced by the vaccine has a high mortality rate ranging from 22% to over 70%, it occurs about 1 in 50,000 doses given in those under the age of 50 and 1 in 100,000 doses given in those 50 years or over. 

The exact mechanism is not currently known, but emerging evidence suggests that possibly a component in the astrazeneca vaccine elicits an immune response against a small protein in the blood called platelet factor 4. Antibodies bind to platelet factor 4 to form a complex that then binds to platelets in the blood activating them and the coagulation cascade leading to the formation of blood clots in the brain and elsewhere in the body. So yes, it is possible for a vaccine to kill someone, but this condition is very rare in the older population and I assume you live in the USA where the astrazneneca vaccine isn't approved.

I was thinking of getting one dose of Pfizer and and then Novavax this fall.

The UK applied this approach and appear to be doing better than Israel.

One very major consideration is that autism diagnostics have changed and improved greatly over time; those who were not vaccinated within the first month of life were more likely to be born in the 1980s (I presume--not that this article says so, which is flaw #1), while kids who were vaccinated within the first month were likely born in the 1990s--when access to healthcare improved significantly (CHIP, early 90s), and diagnostic criteria for autism began to change.   


2) The authors are notoriously absolutely terrible. Conveniently discussed here: [https://www.healthline.com/health-news/scientists-fake-autism-study-data](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/scientists-fake-autism-study-data)  


3) Gayle DeLong lives by a cross-sectional dataset--she should really stop, but she's an economist rather than an epidemiologist. Cross-sectional data is helpful-ish as maybe an indicator that something should be looked at more closely, but it isn't proof of anything--it is nearly the definition of correlation doesn't equal causation. Of course, it has been looked at more critically--vaccines don't cause autism. Further discussed here: [https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/vaccines-cause-autism-until-you-look-at-the-data](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/vaccines-cause-autism-until-you-look-at-the-data)  


4) I didn't read it because I don't actually want to go through all of these, but thimerasol hasn't been in childhood vaccines in 20 years, and yet the autism rates have not declined (they have risen, largely due to, again, increasing access to care and services and improved diagnostics.) The study was on 12 families. 

Okay, that's 4. I glanced at the others--several more talk about thimerasol, several others don't actually get at vaccines at all, but the authors of the article you linked say that it could mean vaccines because of heavy metals (none of which are in vaccines.)

Vaccination reduces your chance of sickness, hospitalisation, and death by over 90%. 

If you are unvaccinated, if you catch covid, and the way things are going everyone will probably catch it at some point, the chance of dying is roughly one in a hundred, and the chance of long term complications is a lot higher - obviously this varies and the chance increases with age, obesity, etc. Unvaccinated you also stand a greater chance of passing it on to others with that risk - some of whom, due to health factors, can't be vaccinated.

Your chance of dying following a vaccination is around 1 in 57000. This doesn't mean the vaccination caused your death as some of these are unrelated deaths, including some covid deaths, and the true figure of vaccine caused deaths is believed to be much lower.

So 1 in 100 if you get covid - and depending on physical condition could be much worse - you could have long term effects - and you increase risk to others.

In any case, an open database like VAERS has of course a problem with underreporting of adverse events, that's a given. The question is, is that a real problem where all kinds of serious adverse events would be missed, or is the data skewed towards more serious reactions? As I'm sure you can imagine, the databases like VAERS typically are more useful for more severe side effects than the more common ones. Here's a study that exemplifies this by looking at two very serious events, anaphylaxis (a severe and possibly life-threatening allergic reaction) and Guillaine Barre Syndrome (GBS, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks the nervous system), both very serious adverse events.

You don't know how healthy you are in relation to nasty effects from COVID. Plenty of people thought they were young, healthy, low-risk, and found out the hard way that there was just something about them or their viral exposure that let COVID get the better of them.

The flu is probably not going to kill me. But as a 20-something I had to run a paper route in the freezing rain with the flu and it was hell for about 3 days. In 2009 I caught what I think was the H1N1 swine flu and had to take time off of classes and time off of work. Those are why I get the flu vaccine every year. I'd far rather have to take time off work for the blahs but otherwise feel okay enough to enjoy myself, than have to take time off of work staying in bed because I can't stay up.

I got the Pfizer, all I had was an ache in my arm for a few hours.  Other people reported some, SHORT TERM, issues with respiration, which is basically based on the level of immune response.  The body will pull whatever resources it needs from the oxygen and metabolic pool to  fight an infection, and sometimes will do the same thing to ""fight"" a vaccine, it's normal, just like people sometimes have a bigger-than-expected reaction to a flu shot.

Bottom line, someone's been feeding you a bunch of bunkum.  as near as I can determine the vaccines are safe, and I'm a 500 pound dude so if they'd cause problems for anyone, I'm a good candidate.

Well yeah.  the problem with being unvaxxed is that there's often a period where you have and can transmit the virus without even knowing you've got it.  You can be contagious  weeks before symptoms develop.

so anyone who's unvaxxed is basically a walking bioweapon, as they can spread the virus without having any idea they have it at all, and you don't know who might have it.

(sure, this can happen to vaxxed people too, but at a MUCH lower rate, and at least you can point to the shots and say you're trying to be safe to be around!)

If a person can be  walking around presenting a potentially lethal threat to others, and hasn't taken every avaiilable precaution, there will be some discrimination, it's basic self preservation",p1sarr,p1sarr,apoordoe,1,vaccines

What they did in the big phase 3 study, is give the doses 28 day apart. The acceptable window was 21-42 days. Other timings may be acceptable too, but weren't part of the clinical studies.

GBS is an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the nervous system instead of virusses and bacteria. This leads to loss of strenght, pain in the limbs and in extreme cases paralysis.

If the kid really does have GBS, he could have responded to any kind of viral or bacterial contamination, from the flu vaccine to food poisoning to HIV. In this case, it was the inactivated virus in the vaccine that triggered the GBS.

The medical community used to think the flu vaccine heightened the chances of GBS cropping up, but through years of observation this has been disproven.
