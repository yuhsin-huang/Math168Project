hai3sr2,1630028810.0,kmag188,"I see what you‚Äôre saying, but it seems pretty anecdotal/surface level.

Our country has been flooded with a ton of heavy information, all at once, in the middle of a global pandemic (which had a ton of people in front of a screen). Some people had an understanding of how the world worked, others had been living their entire lives with rose-colored glasses. Some people were familiar with technology and social media, others have limited media literacy (only used social media as a scrapbook, don't understand memes, don't know how to tell the difference between trolling and valid info). 

Everything we knew was called into question before the initial lockdown. MSM, law enforcement, government, history books/schools, ""freedom of speech"" on the internet without understanding TOS, so people went to the internet for answers. The lockdown happened and everyone started questioning scientists/doctors/hospitals/elected officials/media, everything got turned up to 11. People had technology and friends/family to help cope with the constant bickering and constant sense of dread. If I was a teen, I'd probably cope with tiktok too bc a lot of things would feel hopeless and depressing. Imagine being in arguments with family over social/political matters and then a family member passes from a virus and you're stuck at home, you'd want society to work on these issues for your own future and be mad at previous generations for unintentionally letting it get this way. And, from what I remember, prior to 2016, people typically didn't discuss many hot button topics or politics, people didn't always vote or care, we became complacent.

We could have stopped all the political theater and handled the situations with efficiency and grace, a country united, but instead we became divided bc of the talking heads and echo chambers. People doubled down on stances without discussion bc of disagreeing with semantics/wording. People donned flags to be ""patriotic"" without questioning decisions being made, unknowingly advocating for blind nationalism. A lot of people pivoting in arguments without understand why the argument is happening. I think tik tok was more so an outlet for ppl who felt/feel marginalized, probably had a bad day or in a home that was torn apart over the past year+, using tik toks to vent. If there‚Äôs brainwashing going on, it didn‚Äôt just start happening now with TikTok. 

Do you know how easy it is to be a troll from another country stoking the flames on social media? Did you know about Russia/Navalny protests and tiktoks relating to them were stifled/fined/banned? Are you familiar with Putin's geopolitical game plan and the steps that it takes to create dissent? It's been around for decades. Are you familiar with reflexive control theory? The only way to damage a world power with a huge military is through the inside with paranoia and false info on all media (in the middle of a pandemic when everyone‚Äôs on their computers it seems. 

You mention rhetoric being used that‚Äôs problematic to patriotism, but I also see a lot of crisp American flags (from all different stages of this country‚Äôs development) popping up all over the place. Not even mentioning January 6th and what a mess that was.

What I think? America and the big industrial workings around it are all corrupt in some sense. It‚Äôs been tried tested and proven. There are elites pulling the strings, if they‚Äôre not pulling the strings they have influence of some form. I think the direction America is taking is genuinely gearing for massive conflict with china. Whether the morals of china are up for debate I won‚Äôt touch. Countries are like companies in the sense that China is a threat to America, no matter which way you square it. Minimum wage, not lookin great rn. Chinas population is higher, much more manpower.

hajsobw,1630068239.0,RedwoodxRings,"You will find this rhetoric weaved into American stuff, it just might not be explicit, direct, or obvious. This also isn‚Äôt something new, either. Soviet communism practically sponsored the Black Panthers, enticing them (amongst other things as well) with this image of a black utopia. These alignments, along with the groups acts and threats of violence led to their demise through COINTELPRO -black activists were targeted by FBI members who deliberately infiltrated the groups with intentions to break them up by getting the leaders hooked on drugs, and spreading gossip to elicit paranoia and questions of loyalty amongst members. There‚Äôs also Black Muslims, led by Malcom X, who welcomed the support and attention of Gaddafi, secretly the useful idiot to Western power players, but this psychopathic terrorist to the rest of the world. Of course that affiliation drew attention to Black Muslims.

And fast forward to today, we have an organization that triggered all types of activism. People assumed their support of the movement/organization was focused on race and the belief that police are inherently racist, the core tenets of said group actually align with communist/Marxist ideologies far more than they do with anything that is concerned about police violence and racial profiling.

These three examples are all American based movements that, on the surface, appear to be about race and civil rights, but each of these examples had an underlying foundation of, or strong influence of something completely different. 

Communism seems to have some of the same psychology as the alleged Satan, whose reputation is to trick people into believing he/his influence does not exist. His every move is done with deception, mimicry, and a game that leaves countless people pledging their allegiance and selling their souls only to find out it was Satan 
 they‚Äôd been playing with once it‚Äôs too late. 

I only use Satan figuratively, not literally. Satan is known to prey upon people ignorance, weakness, and their desires. That make young people great targets. Communism infiltrates society by approaching each generation of people differently, and capturing the allegiance of the youth is one of the most important tactics regardless of what politics are involved. 

What I have noticed, and what studies today reveal is that at some point in the last 20 years, the history of Communism was either completely removed from education, was barely mentioned in curriculums, or was taught in a manner that left students feeling neutral or more supportive of communism/socialism than their predecessors. 

And what I happening now is having all of the tactics that have been used to bring about Communism into a society are being used, without explicitly trademarking the agenda as Communist. In other words, it‚Äôs like the youth of today is being infiltrated - social media and public figures/celebrities, along with cancel culture (which really preys upon the young teen/adult‚Äôs desire to fit in) are being used to essential homogenize young voters‚Ä¶ they are subscribing to ideologies because embracing the counterparts would humiliate them as a pariah. They support ideologies without thought, because they‚Äôve been led by fear and normalization - but their minds are completely conditioned‚Ä¶ and by the time they are ready to vote, they‚Äôve been shaped into full fledged Communists without even understanding what the word actually means.  That‚Äôs the sneaky  part.  They were groomed to become commies without even understanding the mind control at play. The C word was likely left out. If Tommy came home telling his mom teachers were encouraging students to subscribe to Communist ideologies that promised them
a job as soon as they graduated school, his parents would probably have a thing or two to say, but if all the core tenets of the party were being instilled into students mind without ever mentioning the C word, I bet you it‚Äôs a way to mold American youth into a hive mind of communists who don‚Äôt know they‚Äôve sold their soul to China.",pc4mlv,pc4mlv,,1,conspiracytheories

This is acting like, ""OMG! They knew about covid-19 in the 60s!""  Nope.  

https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus-history  

>Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. Some of them cause the common cold in people. Others infect animals, including bats, camels, and cattle. But how did SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, come into being?  

>Here‚Äôs what we know about the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has set off a global pandemic.  

>Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?  

>Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That‚Äôs also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.  

>SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan‚Äôs open-air ‚Äúwet markets.‚Äù They‚Äôre where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.  

>Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.   

>Still, the Wuhan market didn‚Äôt sell bats at the time of the outbreak. That‚Äôs why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.  

>As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It‚Äôs now spreading in the U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus. This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic.   

>Coronavirus Evolution  

>Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.  

>Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes fever, headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.  

>MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been in people who live in or travel to the Middle East. This coronavirus is less contagious than its SARS cousin but more deadly, killing 858 people. It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure.",pa5olc,pa5olc,SilentStorm95,1,conspiracytheories

If they wanted people to take the vaccines and believe them at their word, they shouldn't have lied every step of the way of this fucking pandemic. They could've shown a semblance of honesty. A very small amount of humility. That's all it would take, but no. They double down, move the goal posts, post obvious bullshit fear-mongering, then wonder why people who still remember the opiate crisis and other blaring issues don't trust them. It's a boy who cried wolf situation, and pretending these vaccines are 100% safe when I have dinosaur chicken nuggets in my freezer older than them is hard to believe.

‚ÄúThe main thing the FDA considers with emergency authorization is, based on the scientific evidence available, that ‚Äúit‚Äôs reasonable to believe that the product may be effective and that the known and potential benefit outweigh the known and potential risks,‚Äù explains Nicholson Price, a professor of health law at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. The medicine or vaccine also needs to be unique, there can‚Äôt be an existing alternative that‚Äôs already been approved. For vaccines, manufacturers were required to provide safety data that was ‚Äúmuch closer to what a company would need for full approval for the vaccine,‚Äù he says. **For emergency authorization, the FDA required two months of safety data versus six months for full approval, he explains.‚Äù**

You must research this yourself. Slide down the rabbit hole at your own risk and discretion. I make no claims of safety or sense. Thank you.)

What if the vaccine is a means for specific effects of the virus to be perpetuated indefinitely?

There was a recent advanced study released by researchers at Harvard and MIT showing that covid, unlike most other viruses, can become genomic in humans. This was studied after people were still testing positive months after their infection had cleared. The viral RNA was transposed back into the genomic DNA due to a specific functional pathway relating to mRNA. It could be speculated that this is part of the picture behind long-term covid, but that's secondary to this discussion.

The specific part of the covid RNA that was observed to become genomic after infection was related up the spike protein. The RNA related to the spike protein is the viral RNA used in the mRNA vaccines. 

Since the virus itself has shown evidence of becoming genomic in humans, specifically through the transposition of this particular chunk of RNA, AND the mRNA vaccines use the same chunk of RNA and the same biological and genetic mechanisms to relay the viral protections they afford, WHAT IF the vaccine creates the same long term effects in the inoculated? Further, since it potentially becomes genomic, could this be an epigenetic event that alters human genomic DNA for future generations? 

Considering that data has already shown high viral concentrations in certain reproductive organs (specifically the ovaries), there is a higher than not chance that any alterations to the genome would be passed down genetically to any offspring.

Again... I'm just thinking out loud, so to speak. This thought experiment merely piggy-backs off of OP's wild speculation, just leading us further out into deep water. There is no scientific validation I am aware of for any leaps of logic in this comment other than the vague ideas specifically outlined here.

h9b6me2,1629219220.0,scoutthespiritOG,"Studies have determined that the vaccine can potentially cause  blood clots that the body cannot repair, the clots keep building until the heart fails. This can happen because of a technology they have developed since the early 2000's called mnp's (magnetic nano particles) these mnps have never been used in humans until now. in layman's terms they're intended use is to draw the virus to a localized points within the body and then terminate the virus, only problem is that research has shown that after the virus dies the body has no way of ridding itself of these mnp's, so they end up becoming stagnant in the blood stream and build up into clots. When the technology first came out it was thought to be ok to use in small quantities however with covid the mnp's are being administered through the vaccine in huge quantities. Once in the blood stream the human body has no way of ridding itself of these nano particles because they are man made and thus will stay in your body until death. Researchers have even determined that because of the inability to leave our body these mnps can put you at a higher risk of developing cancer later in life. Im no scientist so i know it sounds dumb the way im writing but please just do your research before calling another person stupid because they disagree with the news and the government. No im not going to put sources because im not here to write a paper and go hunting for sources after i just woke up. So do your own research and remember that when someone disagrees with you its not because they are an idiot, but because they have read or seen or heard or experienced things you might haven't that has given them a different perspective. Personally i knew two people who died only about a week after getting both vaccines, both from heart failures.

They've gotta play ball with the Taliban, present themselves as a friend, and then gradually milk them for their opium.

There are a number of reports of drug shortages in the United States since the pandemic hit, some of these drugs being morphine and fentanyl, both opioids.

The possibility of the reemergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored.‚Äù Published 2007 in some microbiology journal. China had a few Sars Cov breakouts after that first SARS breakout. In all likely hood covid-19 spread for years around China before it went full pandemic. I think it‚Äôs clear China does not give a shit about their poor people.

I wouldn't be able to make it too dangerous because I would need to  infect my own country in order to maintain deniability. It is naive to think we haven't done this in the past and it is naive to think we will not do this in the future.

Hypothetically, even if we have not done this in the past, this pandemic will make it much more likely that we eventually do deploy a global bioweapon.  The Covid pandemic will have served as a proof of concept...hard data.

The fact that we can not definitively prove whether COVID-19 is artificial or natural shows that a viral weapon is deniable.  The damage this has done to our economy shows that it's effective.  How each country reacted shows which targets are most vulnerable and whether or not one's own country will fare well.

In July of 2019 (long before any Covid bs) I bought a THC cartridge from a sketchy source. I developed a chronic lung problem after smoking it for a few days. I couldn‚Äôt breathe and coughed like I never had before. I started researching and found that the vape problems that Trump was trying to ban were actually THC cartridges that originated from China. I read an article from Australia that expounded on that. I‚Äôm just wondering if in those cartridges, the Chinese put some variant of the sars virus (not COVID-19 because that‚Äôs transmissible and this wasn‚Äôt) just to see what kind of effect the disease would have on the lungs and other organs and then find a way to make it transmissible between humans, preferably transferred by respiration as that‚Äôs the most efficient way to transmit a disease.

h8twm9s,1628887886.0,,"I think you‚Äôre right about the governments of the world not caring until it affected their bottom line. The vaccine hurting people based on 3 articles that don‚Äôt specifically say anything about mRNA vaccines making people hosts for COVID. (Hell, the second 2 articles don‚Äôt even mention mRNA at all). I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre understanding those articles correctly, sorry.

The way I‚Äôm understanding them is that they can‚Äôt use typical vaccines that inject small harmless (easily bearable) doses of the virus because there‚Äôs too much potential for mutation and spread. That‚Äôs WHY they‚Äôre going with mRNA. Those articles came out around the time the mRNA vaccines were approved. mRNA circumvents that issue because it doesn‚Äôt require you to get the virus to grow antibodies. The articles you cited are saying that antibodies aren‚Äôt effective against COVID.

At least, that‚Äôs what I understood from reading them.

I also don‚Äôt expect a huge uptick in severe cases for those who are vaccinated.

According to the CDC, as of August 9, 2021 out of 166 million vaccinated in the US, there were about 8054 breakthrough infections that resulted in hospitalization or death. That‚Äôs about 0.00004% (of the vaccinated US population). Out of that 8054, 5830 died or were hospitalized from something OTHER than COVID. Which means they were asymptomatic or were dealing with something else and just happened to have it. That means only about 0.00003% (of the vaccinated US population) died from COVID or were hospitalized due to severe COVID symptoms after being vaccinated. Additionally, the overwhelming majority (74%) of the people that were hospitalized or died, were 65 or older. And finally, of that 8054, only 1587 of them actually died and only 1246 of those who actually died actually died from COVID. I‚Äôm not trying to make light of real deaths, but the fact is:

Out of 166 million vaccinated people in the US, since vaccines started circa February-March, there have only been 1587 deaths with breakthrough COVID infections which makes up 0.000009% of the vaccinated population in the US.

Not only that, but American culture actively worships a very childlike ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right and you‚Äôre wrong‚Äù mentality. 

These adult-children have been neglected, lied to, used and abused by their government ‚Äúparents‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not even kidding, my theory on these people (and the reason why so many people support trump) is that  they‚Äôre acting out in a plea for attention from their parents. Like troubled, neglected children. The defiance is literally a childlike response, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna listen to mom and dad and the teachers because I‚Äôm sad and neglected‚Äù and this all stems from decades upon decades of wage stagnation and the government showing it does not care, at all, about the average American.

Imagine conflating death threats with not agreeing with what the government is doing. Do you not realise or not care how dangerously open to abuse it is,  to say that saying ""wrong things"" that have the ""potential"" to cause more strife needs to be regulated?  

Further,  there is absolutely no way that you hold all subs to this standard. Because this type of loosely written rule can be used to censor anything

Also,  NNN and subs are not one person and they didn't simply ""spread misinformation"". They discuss idea that are counter to the narrative. If course,  by definition,  as a containment sub they will also attract the crazies. Oh how convenient,  now we can ban them.

Bullshit. Coronavirus banned me for pointing out that the AAP are sponsored by Pfizer,  and that pointing this out was a conspiracy theory. Coronavirus banned me for 'downplaying' covid,  because I asked if we should be taking the same approach to deaths from other viruses. If you hype up covid you'll never be banned for misinfo.

You used the example of getting banned from some subs for speaking your mind, or not having the same political views, and I think that's the perfect example of how these websites do not actually promote freedom or equality. They aren't actually promoting equality and understanding they're promoting a political motivation that some groups have more actual freedom than others, which is of course actually inequality. It's ironic when a group of women is allowed to sexualize someone like Channing Tatum for days but if men sexualize a woman in lingerie, they're pigs and someone will try reporting you for sexism or harassment or w.e. If black people want to call someone a cracker or honkey or any other white slur it's perfectly acceptable, if white people do it's not okay. Like if a black rapper talks about drugs, guns, violence and abusing women it's perfectly acceptable and nobody bats an eye, and kids these days want to ban Eminem for saying the same exact stuff.

So, use your words to discuss, rather than spread unfounded truths, speculations and flat out lies, because you can cause some serious damage.
