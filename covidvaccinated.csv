hb75j2y,1630510446.0,LeanderT,"In many countries including my own AztraZeneca is not used for young people because the side effects are higher for young people. They've stopped AztraZeneca a few months ago in many countries.

It may also be that the effects of AztraZeneca on the menstrual cycle simply arent know, since it has been most often used on people over 60. AztraZeneca has been used a lot in the UK, so maybe they have data on this? 

Issues with the menstrual cycle are reported, although I haven't seen any confirmation by official sources.

For most women who report these, they do go away after a few months. My wife experienced something similar after her vaccinations. However we never made the connection, so we never reported it. After 4 months everything was back to normal. 

If you are planning to get pregnant, than getting a vaccination is very advisable. The Delta variant is really dangerous for pregnant women.

Personally I would avoid AztraZeneca, and prefer Moderna or maybe Pfizer.

Also try not to worry too much. You may be overthinking this. If menstrual problem were really common and not only temporary, it would have been reported much more often. So either it is really uncommon, or a temporary side effect which gas been mostly 'overlooked' as a side effect of the vaccin.",pfo08o,pfo08o,TinyTopaz,1

AstraZeneca is a vector vaccine. To my knowledge, AZ, J&J, Sputnik, CanSino are the first vaccines of this type to be approved. As with mRNA vaccines there had been decades of work with them and many prototypes for many diseases, which helped enormously in getting them fast. Functioning principle is actually quite similar, but instead of a lipid nanoparticle, they use a virus to get inside the cell and force them to make the spike protein.

You're not supposed to take NSAIDs because they're immunosuppressive (though they told me when I got the vaccine that you can take Tylenol, not Advil, if you do get side effects). My main tips: move that arm around to reduce the soreness, stay hydrated, and just go to bed early if you feel tired.

I felt a bit off for a few days after my first shot - nothing as serious as a fever or anything, I just didn't feel 100%. The biggest problem was the arm pain which started maybe around 6-8 hours post-vaccine and lasted a couple of days. The pain is starting to hit me rn with my second dose and I can feel the muscle that was injected aching every time I move.

Taking doctors out to lunch, buying things for office staff and giving other ‘perks’- while odious now, was standard at the time for many drug companies.

The second article talks about a settlement by Pfizer in a lawsuit dating from 2004, alleging that Pfizer marketed the drug Neurontin for things like pain control and seizures.

This link should be helpful.

I'm wondering, though, are you looking for raw data? If so you might need to do some work. First, these will be BIG datasets, probably using some format that would require a statistical software package like R or STATA. I'm only familiar with SPSS.

There's a link there for people who are researchers and regulators interested in patient-level data (raw). It might require IRB approval to access, as this information may comprise PII- personally identifiable information, or, because it would be a review of existing records and they would want there to be sufficient safety measures regarding data security if indeed the information contained PII. Would stand to reason that the data would be de-identified before handing it off to researchers or probably before even being stored for analysis, using some code that references something like the date of entry into the trial and the cohort, whatever.

Federal clients, and of course monetize any visualizations for media outlets. 

One departure I have from your (clearly informed) take is that I don’t think Pfizer will be including any actionable PII with these datasets. Not even to limited access TFA users or PIs at clinical sites. I know their protocols all have boilerplate requiring study site encrypted storage, and pretty strict encryption in transit standards. And even then I’m pretty sure they require linkages to anonymize the patient info associated with their irreversible hashed-ID.

You aren't infected or sick with anything. The symptoms are coming from your defense system's dress rehearsal, and they mean it's preparing itself exactly the way you want it to.

Then, last month, I went through a period of extreme fatigue, dizziness and nausea, but I did recover from that after ten days.

One diagnosed me with Neurosis, and the third, a neurologist, said he had no theories about what was causing my symptoms and flat out told me “After effects of the COVID vaccine only last 48 hours.” Asshole! The two female doctors believed me and ran tests trying to figure out what was happening. My immunoglobulin came back very high.

You do not want to get too weak from too low of calories - will make you feel even worse. I am glad you didnt get a second dose. Really smart decision. You are young - the chances of developing severe covid symptoms is super low in the unvaccinated- like 99.86%. Did you get covid prior? Usually with the first dose - people do not get that many side effects unless they had covid prior - that is why the second doses really does damage. You may have had covid and not even know it. They like to say these vaccines are safe and effective but it is based on new mrna technology and honestly - with something that has been out  a few months - how do they know it is safe? They have to keep updating the side effect list like with myocarditis (heart inflammation) months after giving out millions of doses. Stay positive and strong!

Free day off I suppose!  


I was told by my doc that, at least with the Moderna Jab, people usually get more severe effects after the 2nd dose, and those who get the bad ones after the first shot are usually people who already had the virus itself- thus kinda making the first jab act more like the second one.

2- for the love of god, please do not rely on feedback from strangers on the internet, Reddit, Facebook, etc as we are not the correct Avenue to seek medical advice. Call your doctor and just ask them, then compare their guidance to the official guidance via cdc and local gov websites.

Day 2 (Sunday): Fatigue, headache, soreness all over.

Day 3 (Monday): Same as day 2. Took the day off work and stayed in bed.

Day 4 (Tuesday): Starting to feel a little better from everything but still not perfect, had the day off in bed again. Started feeling a little 'weird' like I wasn't quite myself but couldn't put my finger on what's wrong.

Day 5 (Wednesday): Went to work, started feeling like my chest was tight at about 10am, and had slight dizziness, feeling of pressure in my head, heart rate went to 110 bpm for a couple of hours. Thought i was just having an anxiety attack as it slowed down when I got home and relaxed on the couch.

Day 6 (Thursday): Heart rate was fine in the morning, once again by 10am my heart started pounding, i started feeling very dizzy again, feeling of pressure in my head (like a head cold) and my muscles in my shoulders and neck started aching, feeling like i was going to faint. At 2pm I went to ER because my heart was still racing. They checked and my heart is fine other than an increased heart rate, blood glucose is normal just said that it's probably just the vaccine and should pass. Went home after my heart rate went down around 5:30pm.

Day 7 (Friday): Still feeling a little off, elevated heart rate (75-90bpm) and dizziness, sore neck, pressure in my head, and blocked ears. 

Day 8 (Saturday): Elevated heart rate (75-90bpm) and dizziness still, still feeling like i have a head cold, sinus pressure and ear pressure.

Day 9 (Sunday): Not too bad, only a little dizziness and didn't really notice my heart rate much, until I went to bed at 9pm at which point it decided to go up again, i started feeling 'weird' and dizzy again, sinus pressure again, didn't get to sleep until sometime after midnight.

Day 10 (Today): Heart rate is currently deciding to go to 90 bpm, dizziness is back, as is sinus pressure and neck aches. Starting to just accept that these things are going to keep happening for however long they do, and will have to ride it out.

 Like a few others, I had some irregular heartbeats and minor chest pains a week after the first jab of the vaccine. It lasted a few days and I was looking at myocarditis or pericarditis as a possible cause, but it's fine now. I might go get an ECG just to be sure, but even if it was one of those it was a mild case that could be treated with anti inflammatories and rest at home. The stories on the internet always are skewed in a negative direction without positve balance and are often biased to illuminate worst cases only, so keep that in mind.

Heart palpitations are scary, but I would still highly recommend getting vaxxed despite having experienced side effects in my chest area. The side effects of the vaccine are far less dangerous than the possible permanent complications associated with getting a bad case or even a mild case of the virus. Even if you had the virus, still get the vaccine so you get better protection against the variants.

No one is making that argument. The vaccine is exponentially safer than getting the illness. From a mortality perspective, even if we count cases where the vaccine could be listed as a secondary cause, the mortality rate is ~7 per million. For comparison, the COVID mortality rate in the US alone as of September is 2099 per million. That’s about 300 times more lethal than the vaccine.

UK doesn't even have a specific system to follow up on vaccine related injuries and the study doesn't even look at clinical effects.

What are you talking about. Hospitalization is included as part of the clinical intervention assessment for incidence rate. Do you know of a major cardiac event that doesn’t require hospitalization?

> UK doesn't even have a specific system to follow up on vaccine related injuries and the study doesn't even look at clinical effects. 

The UK has the NIH. Perhaps one of the worlds most comprehensive and widely available health systems in existence. What “clinical effects” do you believe were omitted? 

> Basically what this study is, is a specific context of the more severe cardiovascular related vaccine adverse events. 

Right. So exactly what it claims to be. The fact that you want to up the signal to noise ratio to demonize vaccines doesn’t mean that the rest of us are interested in such a garbage narrative. Especially clinicians and data scientists that need to evaluate this data for IRB assessment.

> In hindsight its known these effects are much more wide spread and undiagnosed in population with such metrics as D-Dimer(clotting) or Troponin(heart attack).

An elevated D-dimer can be caused by many factors and is not even a test that is routinely administered after vaccination. Never mind that elevated D-dimer levels are not proof of blood clots ([here](https://factcheck.afp.com/http%253A%252F%252Fdoc.afp.com%252F9HK9UY-6)).

[Current research has not shown a link between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and blood clots](https://health-desk.org/articles/there-s-no-evidence-that-mrna-vaccines-are-linked-to-blood-clots).

Look, blood clots with low platelets, including blood clots in the brain and heart, occur at an estimated rate of 5 to 16 cases per million people annually. Reports by The MHRA suggest that after the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the incidence rate stood at 14.9 events per million, and 1.8 per million after the second. Lower than the annual baseline incidence rate before the mRNA vaccines existed. ([here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting).)

We also evaluated the risk of prespecified secondary outcomes of interest, namely CVST, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events according to a prespecified protocol.

It’s actually a really robust way to evaluate the risk, since it also striated for any notable incidence outside of defined populations or age groups. This provides a degree of specificity to the risk evaluation that would have been absent if they had confined it to a dual category distinction and then striated form there.

Now it’s about “the chances of serious c19 infection in certain age groups potentially creating a higher vascular event total than leaving them alone?! I would honestly rather you just say you’re never going to get it, never do your part to help protect our society and we can just cleave off some portion of the south and let you all handle it yourselves.

Also, this:

Stop it. No one is being forced to do shit. You know this, I presume. But you use this language to play the victim and manipulate how people view our country’s response to this pandemic. Stop it.

This compares with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per 1 million patients in the 28 days following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test.”

So, let’s just be as generous with these estimates and **combine** the increased risk of myocarditis from **both** the first and second doses of the vaccines, and then compare it against the increased risk of myocarditis following COVID:

Vaccines: 2+1+6+10 = 19 per million people

also, about the generally feeling terrible: remember that feeling like crap for a couple days afterward is actually a good sign. (i know that sounds fake & like a copout but stay with me!) the vaccine is supposed to trigger a strong immune response, so if you feel terrible the next day that means it was successful in doing so, and you will likely have strong immunity from the vax compared to those with milder “side” effects.

A history of COVID-19 infection associated with feeling sicker 

Now, you may have heard the rumor that folks who have had COVID-19 are more likely to feel sick after receiving a vaccine. According to 23andMe data, that seems to be true — a larger proportion of consented research participants previously infected with COVID-19 reported feeling sick, for every degree of sickness (from “a little” to “extremely”), compared to those not previously infected with COVID-19. In fact, only a third of participants with a previous infection experienced no symptoms from their vaccine, compared to half of those without a COVID-19 history. 

 


 

Even after controlling for the key demographic variables listed above, having a history of a COVID-19 infection increased your odds of experiencing any symptoms or feeling very/extremely sick after your vaccination, both by about 30%.",pd28zw,pd28zw,Threeofnine000,1

One of the CNBC anchors recently asked Gottlieb whether natural immunity wasn't being factored in enough and he said yes, but didn't really want to say it.

Ultimately, whether your exposure is in the wild or with a concentrated intramuscular injection, it is up to your immune system to do the work with the information given (which is why vaccines aren't 100% effective).  I could conceive of a vaccine using gene replacement therapy targeting the receptors HIV needs to infect cells, but I don't even know if anyone is working on that.  There is a village in the UK where descendants are immune to HIV because they have a mutation that removed the receptor it needs to infect.

hakhqeo,1630078990.0,holamund0,"We definitely need to keep track of how the landscape of variants and immunity evolves. So far it's looking promising for natural immunity, as it seems to wane at a much slower pace than vaccination induced immunity. I'll refrain from making any recommendations for the previously infected to get vaccinated or not.

I will say though, that studies like these point out how ridiculous it is to group (and treat/judge differently) people based on their vaccination status, rather than their immunity status. I've been saying this all along: we need to focus on immunity, not on ""vaccinated or not.""

It makes absolutely no sense, for example, to impose blanket limits based on vaccination status considering there exists a cohort _within_ the unvaccinated (those with previous infection) that on average has better immunity than the fully vaccinated.",pcnm69,hake1z7,,2
hakz64v,1630085888.0,person2599,"This is not argument. This is a study. This is what you base decisions on. If other studies show the same thing, vaccinating people who got covid will literally be unethical.

I still dont know who thought it was a good idea to vaccinate sick people other than the financial departments at pfizer/j&j/etc. I they went with oh see this is soon much more S protein anti bodies than covid makes. But there are probably dozens other proteins in the virus itself.

Which in hind sight, makes sense, because if the S protein changes, the other proteins will PROBABLY stay the same/ similar to premutation. Especially that the coronavirus family in general has a lower mutation rate relative to other viruses. 

Dont mistake that with that it never mutates, it just that a fast spreading virus has more opportunity to mutate in the same period of time.",pcnm69,hake1z7,,2

halwf3z,1630099782.0,ntalwyr,"I’m concerned that this limited study is causing a lot of people to make the decision not to get vaccinated and then get wrecked by delta. 

I only know 3 people personally who had confirmed covid before and then have had delta recently, but it has rocked all of them (major symptoms/ER visit). All of the breakthrough cases post-vax I know of have been very mild). 

Obviously this is purely anecdotal, but if ending up in the hospital after having previously had covid isn’t even unusual in my small community, it seems a little crazy that the stats shaped up in that direction.",pcnm69,pcnm69,holamund0,1
halxslp,1630100390.0,holamund0,"Yeah. I mean, it's happening with the fully vaccinated as well. As this study shows, for the _most_ protection, the safest thing to do to prevent delta infection is to get vaccinated regardless of previous infection status. And if you have access to boosters, I'm sure those help too.

Neither natural immunity nor vaccination are fool-proof. But I'm tired of people completely disregarding natural immunity when the data doesn't warrant it and treating people who want to talk about it as anti-vaxx idiots. Not trying to motivate people to not get the vaccine. My incentive is to spread what the data is showing, without any politics involved. There's nuance to this whole discussion. There needs to be more objective discussions happening.

> it seems a little crazy that the stats shaped up in that direction

Honestly I was surprised as well. The data coming out of the UK seems to be trending in that direction too, as in natural being at least as good as double-dose vaccinations. So I'm a bit more confident this isn't some one-off fluke study.",pcnm69,halwf3z,ntalwyr,2

hahxhtb,1630025801.0,Dehibernate,"So you've outlined the possible outcomes but it's probably more important to look at the probabilities and the data we have. 

However you look at it, COVID categorically has higher rates and severity of side effects compared to the vaccines.

It's worth mentioning that there's a definite negative bias in regards to vaccine side effects. What I mean is that rare side effects will often get blown out of proportion, both in the media, and by people, which is understandable because the stakes for the cure are higher. Attention needs to be brought to minimise risk. The side effect is that the perceived risk from the vaccine becomes much higher than the actual risk, which muddles things. 

It's also worth considering that there are about 250 million recorded COVID cases worldwide and 4.5 million deaths as a result. Long COVID rates aren't firm but estimates from UK's ONS put it at 20% for 5+ weeks and 12% for 18+ weeks of symptoms. If we look even at the lowest age groups of children from 2-11, about 10% get long COVID. So you can expect a slightly higher chance of we can safely extrapolate from that. 

In contrast, there have been more than 5 Billion vaccine doses administered, which is an order of magnitude more data than total recorded COVID cases. There aren't global death figures, but in US for example the death rate is reported at 0.0019% (6,968 deaths out of 363m doses), which coincided with taking the vaccine but may not have necessarily been caused by it.

Measurements and reports of side effects from the vaccine are also more stringently recorded, analysed and reported by govts compared to COVID. Because of that, risks are brought to a minimum (e.g. the temporary suspension and consecutive age restrictions for Astrazeneca to over 30s). The severe side effects like myocarditis and blood clots are in the probabilities of less than 1 in 1,000,000. I haven't found any official reports on longer lasting symptoms, comparable to long COVID, but I would expect if they were prevalent enough, we would have an official probability estimate. 

In my view, looking purely at the data, the vaccine is significantly safer in almost every aspect. The fact that there are enormous amounts of data on side effects constantly coming in, which is stringently analysed, also means that the data on vaccine safety is more accurate than the data on COVID itself.",pcay79,pcay79,basicslovakguy,1
hajtlza,1630068705.0,basicslovakguy,"Thank you for your comment. And sorry for late reply.

&nbsp;

> rare side effects will often get blown out of proportion  
> perceived risk from the vaccine becomes much higher than the actual risk, which muddles things

2 things on this:

- yes, I think this is the reason I am reluctant to just go with it, like I would go with any other vaccine for different disease;  
- governments - and for that matter, health care industry itself - are not doing enough to communicate the advantages and disadvantages of Covid vaccines (that's my perception from media in our country);

On top of that, if comments in this subreddit are something to go by, apparently reporting systems can be abused to certain degree ? In 21st century we don't have a bullet-proof way that only people who were actually vaccinated would be able to report anything in regards to vaccine they took ?

&nbsp;

Another thing - I cannot shake the feeling that there is a massive push to get as many people vaccinated because that's the way to return things to normal. But, I am yet to hear government officials say something to the effect of ""People ! We are at X % of vaccination rate. Once we reach Y %, we are going to drop the rest of restrictions, because at that point our health care system will be able to handle whatever influx of ill people will be created, should something new show up."".

&nbsp;

Other than this, I don't have much else to say. In fact, now that you brought up the whole negative bias thing, I might just jump the fence, and hope that I was right with my decision. But, the whole situation (and how it is being handled) just does not feel right to me.",pcay79,hahxhtb,Dehibernate,2
haog804,1630156554.0,combinatorialist,"Those are all great questions, but one thing that might help is to realize that you're comparing risks in which one has a WAY higher chance of happening in all those scenarios.  

Here's an analogous comparison: ""If I choose to get surgery to remove this cancerous tumor so it doesn't spread, I could have an infection or complication from the surgery.  If I choose to not get surgery, the cancer could resolve on its own or it could progress to a stage of cancer that can't be treated with simple surgery and I'd have to get chemo.  How do I choose?""

The answer of course is that you choose the surgery, because while any medical procedure carries some minor risks, the risk of the cancerous tumor spreading is so much higher that it's not even a comparison, and you should definitely get the tumor removed.  Similarly, you should definitely get vaccinated, because the risks are absolutely infinitesimal compared to the risk of catching and becoming very ill by the Delta variant of covid.",pcay79,pcay79,basicslovakguy,1

hai8ua8,1630031166.0,10MileHike,"I'll repeat what I've said in other topics.

Everyone in the world who has faced a tough decision doesn't always get the time they need, nor the data they need, to feel 100% surety.

Yet those kinds of decisions are made each and every day by leaders in the military, leaders in medicine, EMS and firefighters, parents with sick children, and people facing cancer diagnoses, etc.

At some point they just have to make a decision because not making one quickly is going to hurt them worse.

Decision-making is something we all need to be able to do, as adults.  Sometimes you don't have everything you need.  Most life-and-death decisions, even by a lifeguard about to jump into water to save a life, isn't cut and dry like figuring out which cell phone to buy.

My thought has always been that there is no such thing as a perfect decision......even a less than perfect decision, **esp. when mission critical and alacrity is required,** can turn out to be the best way forward.

THis is the differnce between an adult with critical thinking skills and a 12 year old child who has not yet reached th necessary milestones to be placed in a decision-making role.   That is why we do not put children in charge of stuff.

* You think there's a media conspiracy to accept vaccinations.
* You think your natural immunity will be enough.
* You only want to take a vaccine if the vaccine guarantees you immunity for years.
* You don't trust mRNA vaccines

I'm just pointing out your position, since it is quite different from what most would consider as ""pro-vaxx"". I thought this clarification would make it easier for others to properly understand where you're coming from.

>Your comment is most coherent wall of text I have read so far on this subreddit, so I will take my chances and speak up here.

>I warmed up to the fact that ""covid shots"" (because I refuse to call those ""a vaccines"") reduce the severity of disease if any person gets it. But the fact that people who got the shot can still get reinfected, and then potentially asymptomatically spread the virus among people is really giving me a pause. Because let's be honest - how many people stayed home with slightly running nose and very mild cough that could be admitted to seasonal allergy or ""something in the air"" ?

>Am I the only one who has this feeling that **there is no pressure to develop a serum that will effectively end the virus** ? We are being **massaged by mainstream media** about how this pandemic will end once we have a huge % of population getting shots, and yet... in grand scheme of things, we will be stuck with getting frequent boosters, and wearing masks, from the looks of it. Because we cannot force 100% of population to get shots - some people simply cannot take any shot whatsoever because of their health complications.

>It really feels like we are trying to just force coronavirus to weaken so much it won't create more complications than seasonal flu, instead of taking radical measures to develop a serum that will, in 95% of people with shots, force the immunity to kill the virus completely. THAT would end the pandemic, and return us to normal.

>Am I afraid of Covid ? Yes, I am. But I still believe that **my natural immunity will take care of it**. But I will take a covid shot - once there is a one that is confirmed to **kill off the coronavirus in my body for years to come** - you know, like other ""vaccines"" that have been fine-tuned and tested over the course of years, and, suprisingly, **don't rely on mRNA technology**.

For local news about COVID-19, your first stop for information should be the website of your local public health authority; they will have the information that is most relevant to your area. In addition to those agencies, the following sites have very detailed and highly reliable information about a broad range of COVID-19-related topic areas, including prevention, therapeutics, and vaccines.

# Scientific News Agencies

In general, quality of COVID-19 coverage varies broadly across news outlets. It's highly recommended that you [look at the reliability](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/) of a news outlet when evaluating the quality of its information. Even the best news outlets, however, sometimes get things wrong or overinterpret scientific evidence beyond that is actually supported. Here are some science-oriented news outlets or scientific journal briefings that are useful for understanding the science as it develops in a more reliable way.

# Science Blogs

Though it's often not ideal to get your information from the blogosphere at large, there are some high-quality blogs and podcasts that are produced by highly qualified individuals and that present the data in a measured and responsible way.

* [This Week in Virology](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/)

# Science Twitter

Twitter is usually a terrible place to get high-quality information. These scientists tend to be the exception to that rule. Please note: though these scientists tend to be pretty reasonable in their interpretation and presentation of data, even these tweets should be interpreted with caution as the opinion of a single individual (albeit a highly trained and qualified one).

# Some Notes of Caution

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a proliferation of interest in research and research studies. This is, of course, a good thing -- it's important for people to be informed about the state of the field and about the development of the science on this critical topic. However, it's also important to be cautious in interpreting scientific studies, even those presented in the best journals. It's well known that much work in the biological sciences is questionable and difficult to replicate, and a single study should never be taken as definitive in and of itself. Studies -- even in the top journals -- are not always high quality. There's always methodological issues with every study that is published, and being able to distinguish the important issues from the less relevant issues takes practice. Authors of scientific papers often make broad claims or may overgeneralize their results without having the data to fully support their interpretations; being able to identify when that is the case takes practice. And sometimes (rarely, but sometimes), researchers fake their data or otherwise engage in scientific misconduct. Without being able to place the study in the broader context of the scientific literature on that topic and related topics, it's easy to misinterpret or overinterpret studies.

One notable example of this phenomenon is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database. This database is *not* a verified compilation of adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines (or any vaccine); this database compiles self-reported, unverified claims from anyone that says they have been vaccinated and chooses to send them an alleged adverse event that happened after they got vaccinated. There is virtually no attempt made to verify or confirm the truth of these claims, let alone their association with the vaccine; in one famous example, a doctor [reported that the flu vaccine turned him into the Hulk](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/11/bill-zedler/bill-zedler-insists-program-doesnt-collect-wide-ra/), and it was accepted to the database. The purpose of VAERS is very limited -- it is meant to provide highly trained and qualified researchers to analyze the data for statistical aberrations with *considerable* effort needed to sort out the garbage from the potentially true signal. And even then, VAERS analysis is just the beginning; much more targeted and rigorous studies are needed to actually determine whether an adverse event is vaccine related. Basically, VAERS is a tool that can be used as a hypothesis generator for researchers -- it should not be interpreted to actually resemble anything even approaching reality.

The point is: when looking for information about COVID-19, exercise caution. Even the sources we have listed above sometimes get things wrong -- sometimes because new data causes a reevaluation of hypotheses and models, and sometimes just because humans make mistakes. Don't get your information from any one source, and don't take any one viewpoint to be the gospel.

Even then, expect to be wrong sometimes -- we've all been wrong at points throughout this pandemic. What's more important is to be willing to update your views as you get more information and to not hold steadfastly in the face of evidence to the contrary. If you look for good sources of information, think critically about it, and are willing to accept change, you'll probably be fine.",pc99jb,pc99jb,lannister80,1

When I have anxiety, I have a hard time moving and stuff. I have also had vaccine symptoms after 2 weeks that are including pins and needles (they are going away thank goodness) fatigue, dizziness, stiff arms and legs. I feel like if you rest, take vitamins, drinks a lot of water (or Gatorade) you will be okay. And also stay off this subreddit too cause reading symptoms over and over will cause anxiety.

hahdau7,1630016436.0,Necessary_Basis,"I am not vaccinated.  With that said though it sounds like you're letting your mind get the best of you.  Anxiety can play tricks on you - I had many of your symptoms back in 2019 when I had an anxiety attack/breakdown.  It lasted a few weeks.  Are you relatively healthy?  Highly, unlikely you're having a stroke. I thought the same thing and also went to the ER.  Are you a heavy drinker? You could have the shakes and withdrawing.

It's going to be all good.  Work on your breath work exercises.  Don't hyper ventilate though to lose oxygen and get the ""tingly sensation""  You can breath in slowly through your nose and out your mouth nice and calmly.  loosen up your shoulders and jaw and relax.  This may be much for some and a little 'Hippyish"" but this dude helped me a lot - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlsUyYruSY4

I also recommend cold showers like for at least 60 seconds but would be good for two mins or more.  Or a cold bath with ice for a couple of minutes.

Do not google symptoms.  Get off google!  You will only go down a black hole.  Only watch things with positivity on TV/YouTube.

In the mornings or evenings throw on some guided meditation videos and play them while lying on your back. It will help you relax.",pc943j,pc943j,butterflyx333,1

Only speculation on my part, but I don't think Novavax will get EUA.

>My boyfriends dad invited me out to a gathering then retracted the invitation saying some guests are afraid of catching COVID from an unvaccinated person. I was fine with that decision…His dad is in his 70s and his friends are in the same age group, all fully vaxxed. They are folks who listen to nonstop CNN MSM related garage…whereby these commentators promise protection against severe illness, and that the unvaccinated population is the reason for the rise in cases.

Don't listen to the media then, listen to science

>I feel like it’s bullshit, because cities has relaxed mandates and have full capacity everywhere you go, that’s the reason why cases are riding, not because of the unvaccinated. Lots of people running around maskless acting like their vaccine gave them full immunity, when it is certainly not the case.

Very few things are ever going to give you full, unconditional immunity. 100% is not the target. If anyone claims that the vaccine is bulletproof, they're wrong. That doesn't mean it's not working as intended.

>At this point, I don’t trust the CDC (they recently tweeted something about invermectin using the word “y’all” - which I find highly immature and unprofessional for a government site).

Their tweet may not have been tactful or well advised. My speculation is that they've exhausted all conventional channels to communicate that you shouldn't self-medicate with veterinary drugs from the tractor store and tried something different to reach out to the people that do this. Rejecting a government agency based on a single tweet seems a little drastic though.

>They’re flip flopping everywhere changing their stories one day to the next.

Some may call it flip-flopping, some may call it updating guidelines as more evidence becomes available. I know I would.

>Their own website even reads they don’t know how long protection lasts, and with the third booster they “think” it’ll boost immunity but so far no data only “hope”.

That's because no one truly knows. The scientific community is still working on figuring it out. I much rather see them admit that it's still unknown than making a guess and then defend it even if it turns out to be incorrect.

>I’m sick of this, I mask up, I don’t go out anywhere, I do my part but WTF?

Aren't we all...

>For those who are fully vaccinated, do you really believe you’re safe ???

Again, I don't like to deal in absolutes. Do I believe I'm 100% safe? No, but I believe I'm *safer* with the vaccine than without it.

>And are you going to get a booster? What if they want you to take more boosters??

I take the flu shot every year due to my line of work, and I will take COVID shots every year if needed. I would prefer if they can combine the two into the same shot to save a trip though.

>And as an added question - are you okay with vaccine passports ?

I feel the idea of ""vaccine passports"" is a bit of a strawman. AFAIK, no government has ever actually proposed a dedicated passport for vaccinated. If you mean proof-of-vaccination; all vaccinations I've ever gotten since birth are documented, so I'm not opposed to the idea to add COVID to that list.

The vaccination passport allows you to enter all areas of entertainment AND places like grocery stores, colleges, etc. If you aren't vaccinated, if your beliefs or preferences oppose you getting vaccinated, your only other choice is to pay over 70 EU for a 48-hour lasting permission (PGR test) to be part of the society, despite the fact that you're otherwise the same kind of citizen that pays full taxes.

Yes, I do believe I'm safe -- not necessarily from getting COVID, but from hospitalization and death. I also believe all the studies and recent data that says that because I'm vaccinated it means I'm less likely to get infected and thus less likely to spread it. 

At the same time, I also agree with you that since the data came out about viral loads being similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and the recent data coming out of Israel, it's important that we all do our part to stay masked and socially distance, even those vaccinated. Not all the blame can be put on the unvaccinated for recent cases.

If it's recommended that I get a third shot, I will take it. I had short-term side effects for both shots (1 day of fever), but no long-term injury. 

Yes, I believe that COVID-19 vaccines should be mandated, with religious and medical exemptions, similar to the current vaccines any school-age child are mandated to get. This is because of the rate of hospitalization and death among the unvaccinated.

The fact that messaging and guidance has evolved over time is a good thing: we don't want a government sticking to an outdated policy when new information points to something better.

It sounds if you are frustrated about the change of messaging about the need to wear masks, the need for boosters, and generally when this will be over. Keep in mind that the virus mutated with the delta variant and changed the situation considerably. The guidance about vaccinated people going unmasked was developed based on data about vaccine effectiveness prior to delta. Delta changed this: it is far more contagious and can infect people who are vaccinated. It is a good thing that the government has adapted the polices to this new reality. The real world is messy sometimes.

You have two options:

* Skip vaccination and contract COVID-19. Statistics are in your favor for survival, but do you want to live with the potential consequences of long term health impacts many people are experiencing assuming you survive.
* Get vaccinated and enjoy a better chance of avoiding infection completely, a better chance of avoiding long COVID symptoms, and a substantially better chance of avoiding hospitalization. You will endure a few days of side effects from the vaccine, and there is a low risk of severe side effects.

Does getting the vaccine mean I'm better protected from getting COVID? Yes it does.

I will continue to social distance and wear masks around strangers. I will wash my hands as much as I can and avoid crowded areas. Is it ideal, no, but I also don't want to deal with this virus forever.

The only way we're getting out of this is by reducing the R rate and achieving herd immunity. Practical measures are one part of the solution. Vaccines, which make infection less likely, are another part, and sadly because of the Delta mutation are more needed now than before.

That being said if a third shot becomes available, I'll be in line to get it and reduce my chances of getting sick. I've had two shots of Pfizer with no side effects, so a sore arm for a few days is worth it, if it means I'm not adding to the problem.

Love vaccine passports, but there MUST be exceptions for people who truly can’t be vaccinated (I have a friend who can’t due to severe vaccine reactions). A doctor would sign off on this.

I have a lot of health issues. Covid would kill me unvaccinated. Covid could still kill me vaccinated. I can’t risk not being vaccinated.

*Yes the vaccines reduce the chances of death and severe disease but you're also potentially opening yourself up to another risk factor that is time and time again being explained away as stress and something that is unrelated to the vaccine and only has a temporal* *relation which may or may not be true for each case.*

*In my humble baby brain opinion, i think if we can deal with wearing an N95 and keep up a strict social distancing mode of behavior and or offer up alternative (not horse related) therapeutics, that holy benefit/ risk ratio decreases. Of course that's on a case by case basis depending on how much we venture out into crowded public places, (public commuting, work with the public, family members, etc)*

*In the end, the vaccines work at reducing severe disease and death and if you would like to get the vaccine by all means, but i think we need to think more holisitically about managing the pandemic and give people scientifically backed and proven alternatives rather than an all or nothing approach by taking a ""magic bullet"" which is obviously not going as planned*",pbzfd1,pbzfd1,Nerodia_,1

hadzeuk,1629953691.0,seigneurdubord,"I had this after my second dose, but I assumed it was my asthma. 

It turned out I had just become really weak because my side effects were so bad that I was bedridden for a week and I was too scared to do anything too physically extreme after that. If you had covid before getting the shot or have an overactive immune system like I do, you’re pretty likely to get crazy side effects. This side effect went away after I did a lot of working out in the following month. I’ve had other random physical ailments like muscle pain and persistent nausea that were made better and eventually fixed by going for long walks regularly, but I cannot figure out why. 

Here is an alternate take that is probably off: If you’ve noticed that your entire body is more tense than usual, too, that could be a contributing factor. I’m not an anxious person when it comes to conscious thought, but my body can never physically relax, so it is REALLY hard for me to breathe when it gets too bad. If you are unconsciously anxious or stressed out about anything, it seems like taking your mind off of it, i.e. by walking for a really long time, would be what is helping. You may just be overly anxious about this aspect of your health and it could be exacerbating your symptoms. I kind of doubt it, though.

Second dose had side effects appear around 12 hours after vaccination. I had a very mild fever (0.1 Celsius over threshold) and a sore arm that was less sore than my first dose.

You should be ashamed of yourself as an individual /u/spez.  Even if an entire PR legal team suggested you posted this information, your individual ethics should have prevented you from doing so.

We’re living in a time where people feel there is no absolutes, no sense of right or wrong, and no way to find out the truth without being inundated (on both sides) with information that is countered by other information, yet all of it is sus. 

The best you can do is make an informed decision for yourself and your family, and prepare for the blow back. I’ve had to uninvite my sister and family from visiting. I have an immunocompromised roommate and they refuse to be vaccinated. 

Polio vaccines had side effects. Small pox vaccines had side effects. Yet People got themselves and their children vaccinated because the saw *for themselves* that the risk in contracting the illness was worse than the risk inherent in all vaccines. But folks today are stuck on social media, or behind computers, and have no personal reference for the misinformation out there. 

When this started in 2020 I was “never” going to get the vaccine. Then in November I got covid. It was mild at first, then I ended up in the hospital, and I have been suffering with long covid ever since. So as soon as a vaccine was available to me, I got immunized. And I’ll be getting a booster as soon as I can. Because *the reality of the virus made me change my mind*. For many people its mild. But for many people it causes permanent lung damage. (I’m one of those) Its not always about “fatality rates”. Its about how potentially sick this makes you, and how, when you contract it, you potentially make all the people that you care about exposed to the same mess. And some people will die from it.

So, you can’t change their minds. But good for you, for changing yours. Get vaccinated. Know that you’re doing the right thing for yourself and those around you. Hope your family members don’t get sick, and btw, let their phone calls go to voicemail or “be busy” when they want to visit. You don’t have to fight their opinion.

Like you get along over most other things and have good relations but on some topics, they have completely opposite views, may not be worth making a big battle over it if it can be avoided. 

That said, the plus side of telling them is it's a burden off your back (like you don't have to worry about hiding it from them and pretending you agree with their misinformation) and you *may* influence others in your family to consider it. Ideally, they see you got the vaccine and were completely fine and then think maybe all the BS they believed as just that, BS. Or they were already on the fence about it but putting up a show for the other family members afraid of being outcasted if they got it. 

If you do the latter, just make sure you have a lot of the data ready showing how the vaccinated are statistically better off in various ways, the odds of severe outcomes are much higher with the unvaccinated, that the Delta variant is very hard to avoid and you don't want to live in a bubble trying to avoid it for the rest of your life, a list of Republican politicians like Trump and right wing political figures who have gotten it (sure the vast majority have but only some have openly admitted it and even fewer have encouraged their base to get it, really pathetic), etc. You're not going to win a battle with facts with the diehard among them but it helps when defending yourself if they give you a hard time.

As someone who suffered for most his life with anxiety/panic attacks, I know all too well the connection between physical processes in the body and incidents of anxiety.

People with injuries are gaslit by the medical community and highly censored online. That being said going by what we know so far, odds are in your favor you’ll have minor side effects at most.

 It’s really hard to find unbiased information in either direction and you have to base the risk/benefit on your own personal health and circumstances. Covid is not something anyone really wants but risk is very low for young and healthy. If you’ve already had covid there’s also very little evidence that a shot will improve immunity much, atleast temporarily.
 I know people are always talking about VAERS being unreliable, and it is sort of. Yes anyone can make a report, but it is monitored for obvious fakes and it’s a criminal offense to make one. It’s not even that easy, you have to provide a lot of specific information. Events are also under reported. So no it’s not the most reliable system but it’s all they’ve given us and at the very least it can be used to look for obvious patterns and that’s exactly what the CDC was looking at when they had concerns of myocarditis in young people. Also you have to look at waning efficacy. Pfizer in particular is much less protective against the delta variant, I’m not sure about the others.

hadoy7s,1629947749.0,QuantumSeagull,">It is a voluntary reporting system that has been estimated to account for only 1% (see the Lazarus Report) of vaccine injuries.

Not so much estimated as it has been *claimed*. I think it's relevant to know that ""the Lazarus report"" is not really a scientific study. It's a report written in 2009 by a company that received NIH funding to develop an ""electronic support system"" for VAERS.

This claim has been used to insinuate that all numbers should actually be 100x as large as reported. So when OpenVAERS (which is a misnomer by the way – the official VAERS is also open) is saying that 13,080 people ""died from the vaccine"", they want you to believe that the real number is actually closer to 130,800.

This is misleading for two reasons;

One reason is that other studies (like this one [https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers/1995AmJPubHlth85-12.pdf](https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers/1995AmJPubHlth85-12.pdf)) estimated that severe reactions are reported to a much larger degree and that it is the mild reactions that are under-reported. Both the American Journal of Public Health paper and the ""Lazarus report"" are pretty old at this point, so it's not unreasonable to believe that improved ease of access, and awareness both from the public and HCP's have bumped those numbers. Especially seeing that the COVID vaccine is on a lot of people's minds.

Another reason is that VAERS is not establishing a causal link between the vaccine and the reports. In its disclaimer, which is not present on OpenVAERS, it's explicitly stating that ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness"". The purpose of VAERS is to collect data so that patterns can be found. OpenVAERS on the other hand makes it sound like the vaccine killed 13,080 people (or 130,800 people if you will).

VAERS is important, and that information access is for the greater good, but just quoting the numbers on the OpenVAERS landing page, and referring to ""the Lazarus report"" is not helpful for people who are *truly* trying to find accurate and reliable information.",pb2m92,haacfih,Satsuma_Sunrise,2

Literally 5 BILLION doses of Covid 19 vaccines have been administered.   364 million shots given in the USA.  Your family believe nonsense conspiracies and are wrong!

The vaccines are very very safe, they all have to go through the same trials normal vaccines go though for approval.  Phrase 3 trials successful on Pfizer late last year, then it was given to 100’s of millions and vaccine side affects closely tracked.

You have a trace extra chance at myocarditis and blood clots cvt.  And a very slight increase in balls palsy.  Slight as in win the lottery type stuff. 1/50000 etc and that doesn’t mean death most who do get those conditions are fine after treatment and some time.

By contrast if you catch Covid-19, not only will you be exposed to the spike protein that’s in the vaccine, you’ll also have the whole virus for your body to fight against.  If you catch Covid-19 your risk of blood clots is 6-8X higher than taking the astra Zeneca vaccine, and your chance of myocarditis is also many multiples higher if you catch the virus instead of taking the Pfizer shot.

It looks like sore arms are very common, but I also ended up growing low-grade fever, I couldn't move my arm by the first day and on the third day I got a bout of explosive diarrhea that knocked me out good.

I got my second dose yesterday at 4pm. I was warned it would hit hard since I've had side effects with the first dose and it *does*. Sore left arm after an hour, blocked arm at 6 so it started much faster. Slight fever at 7, felt sluggish and out of focus. Took paracetamol to aid sleep because of the arm pain (it's swollen this time), went to sleep, woke up at 4am with trembling teeth and chills all over. It's currently 80F in my room but I had to wear wool socks, trousers, undershirt, shirt, blanket, two heavy blankets to stop the chills. Fever got to 102, took another gr paracetamol at 7 in the morning. Fever went slowly down but in the last hour it's been rising again to 102, so I'm debating if taking another pill is advisable or not as I feel like S.H.I.T and my skin is still covered in goosebumps, so it will likely keep rising. Brain fog is real, I had trouble remembering where we keep our water in the house.

I'm reading now (local newspapers) that those at the gov are thinking about a third dose but are worried about the side effects coming from mRNA vaccines, as they seem to escalate on each dose. All my family members either did Pfizer/AstraZeneca and NOBODY had anything. Moderna's the only choice in my area these days and by my anecdotal experience with friends and family acquaintances it's the strongest of all the vaccines out there as many more people were knocked out in bed than with Pfizer.",payd2t,payd2t,savtoj,1

I LOVE the opportunity to help people any chance I get and it is unfortunate the things I have had to see people deal with. I'll give you an anecdotal story like everyone tends to do. I was big time on the fence, and people being pretentious assholes never helps. My EMS company had a director quit, and the hospital that employs us got a new VP that kinda took over the EMS division for the time. We have been run down pretty hard for the last year and some change, and not just Covid but everything else EMS entails. Morale is at an all-time low and then they mandate the vaccine after everyone works their tails off for the last year and whatever.

We had a meeting about some things and of course he brought up the vaccine. In a division full of the most burned out PTSD ridden guys and gals, he took 5 extra minutes to tell us he appreciates us, supports us, and he will still love and support us whether we get the vaccine or not. He encouraged, of course, but he made sure we knew he understood the reasons we didnt want to get it. Be that as it may, come 01 Oct, those who were unvaccinated would be on the job market and he stressed he would still love and respect us and appreciate everything we have been doing for the community in desperate times.

That's when I made up my mind to go ahead and get it. I felt like I'd been heard, I felt appreciated, and I felt like I could continue to serve the community with a renewed vigor. Whats my point? Someone who clearly showed they valued us through action beforehand took the time to demonstrate that he doesn't think we're idiots, he didnt cuss at us, he didnt disrespect us and all our hard work.

ha7ux70,1629843064.0,Sensitive_Proposal,"You are vastly misunderstanding the risks associated with the vaccine and Covid. 

Your risk of myocarditis from Covid is at least 20++ times the risk of myocarditis from the vaccine. 

In short, you have a much much much greater chance of getting myocarditis (and pericarditis) if you catch Covid than if you do get the vaccine. 

And to be honest, myocarditis /pericarditis from the vaccine goes away. In almost all cases, there is absolutely no need to be hospitalised. Your risk of hospitalisation from Covid is literally at least a hundred times greater, as is the risk of long term health consequences from the myriad of other issues you can get from Covid. Kidney failure. Neurological (brain) issues like early onset dementia, seizures, issues with regulating blood pressure and breathing and balance etc, lung issues requiring eg lung transplants, serious blood clotting issues etc all these are associated with Covid. 

All of these risks are considered and weighed up by your governments vaccine body, and taken into account before approving the vaccine in any age group in your country. They make sure that there is vastly more risk from catching a disease than being vaccinated before it is approved in any age group, sex or any other demographic. 

So yes, you absolutely should go get vaccinated NOW.",passhy,passhy,,1

ha7d2l5,1629835662.0,boredtxan,"Good on you for trying to do some kind of risk assessment, but you are just getting started.  Yes, myocarditis is a risk (both of the vaccine and COVID infection) and I had to help my 15 year old make his choice.  Here's what else we added into the assessment...

1.  Did he have covid before (no)
2. What type of risk environment would he be in for covid? over crowded classrooms with unvaxxed kids in a majority ""pandemic denial"" county for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, so high chance of exposure to a high viral load.
3. How would he feel about potentially transmitting it to others in the family and his friends?
4. What is the prognosis with myocardiaits? It responds well to treatment and most people recover just fine.  If it is from the vaccine that is the only thing wrong with you and if it is from COVID infection you have other body systems also impacted.  
5. If you get COVID and are not hospitalized, can you still financially, academically, at work etc endure a potentially long illness ?  Have known more than a few people who ran fever for 14+ days.
6. Are you ready to accept the risk of getting ""long"" COVID, where symptoms can drag on for moths?  It is difficult to calculate the risk of this since we don't know why it happens yet but those that have it are struggling.

I suspect that if you are at risk for myocarditis from the vaccine, it is NOT logical to assume you wouldn't get it from COVID infection, so avoiding the vaccine may not get you anything in terms of avoiding myocarditis.

There are good reasons that doctors, recommend the vaccine for people like you, the potential beneifts really do outweigh the risks.  My 15 year old decided to get the vaccine and got Pfizer.  He had a sore arm for a few days with both shots and that's it.  His younger sister felt crummy for a day after the second shot.  No problems with their friends or cousin either.

ha727bd,1629831341.0,QuantumSeagull,"A few points;

First; the report seems to be based on myocarditis cases reported to VAERS. VAERS is not judging if it was the vaccine that caused it, or if it was just a random occurrence. If a patient presents with myocarditis sometime after getting the shot – it will end up in VAERS. VAERS also doesn't require a diagnosis. It's entirely possible to self-diagnose with myocarditis and subsequently self-report it to VAERS. The fact about VAERS not verifying a casual relationship is important because the conservative estimate for yearly incidence of myocarditis is 1/5000. I've seen other sources claim it may be as high as 1/1000. And this is without the COVID-vaccine.

Second; you're equating myocarditis to hospitalization. I frequently see people who walk into the clinic, get diagnosed with myocarditis, then walk out with a prescription. Far from every myocarditis case requires hospitalization. I don't have a number, and I suspect it's hard to find a reliable number because mild cases of myocarditis are not always diagnosed.",passhy,passhy,,1

habnofj,1629915956.0,Switchy249,"I had Covid in January. I’m in my 20’s. I’m not the fittest guy around. I’m a software developer (I sit in a chair for 16 hours a day basically). I’m not overweight, I eat fairly decently. 

Covid kicked my ass to hell and back. I felt like my lungs were on fire. I couldn’t breathe for shit. I was laying on my side for 2 weeks, watching scrubs. Trying my best to stay positive. I was unvaccinated at the time of catching the virus. (My country didn’t let people my age get shots yet).

I genuinely thought I was going to die. I spoke to my doctor, I was prescribed a steroidal inhaler, 2 puffs, twice a day. Did it help? I can’t say for sure, I don’t know wether it was placebo or not.

I got an X-ray around late February, doctor said all clear all okay. But I still felt like I couldn’t breathe properly. I was on this inhaler for 6 gruelling months. I couldn’t go in humid areas cause I really struggled. 

Around February these weird rashes started showing up on my arms, started at my elbows and moved up my triceps. First one arm then the other. (I can show pictures for proof). I thought it was psoriasis as my mother has it. Doctor said it wasn’t psoriatic but gave me a steroidal cream and Epiderm which is basically an ointment and just kept it moist. 

Could I say that helped either? No probably not. It stopped the itching for sure, the rashes just made me want to rip my arms off.

The brain fog is unreal, trying to work and I’m just so much slower at my job than usual. Making silly mistakes but I have a great company that supported me and helped me just get back to doing my daily things. They understood which I’m so so grateful about. 

Cut to June 15th. I take a multi-vitamin orange drink thingy, drink about 750ml of water as soon as I woke up. I go get my shot of Pfizer. I’m a hypochondriac, so any little thing I feel is wrong is like mega wrong for me. My arm goes dead in the evening, I had the shot at 9am. I start to feel like I’m gonna puke absolutely everywhere, I don’t but I feel like I’m gonna for about 2 hours then it subsides. I start to get a headache, couple painkillers, problem solved. The following morning, I shit you not. No more rashes, they just upped and fucked off. What was in that fucking vaccine?? That’s some good shit.

Couple more days later, arm goes back to normal from feeling dead. I forgot my inhaler, you know what, fuck it, let’s see. I’m not dying to reach it, let’s see what happens. A week goes by, not even a single use. I can breathe again, I’m not having to take breaks and just gasp for air. 

Sorry I’m all over the place with this story, but during those 6 months I had remember to breathe, my brain would like tick, hey you’re not breathing good enough, deep breath. I sat next to an open window all through winter/spring. Fresh air kept me going.

That fucking vaccine, made me feel like me again. It’s an absolute miracle, those Germans are fucking geniuses. I’m sure Moderna is absolutely fine too, as with the others. My brother had Moderna. My SO had astrazenaca. We’re all fine. My SO had no long lasting Covid effects, but she had 1 dose before our infection.

Get the jab. Any jab. Just do it. You’ll either save your life or somebody else’s. It’s miraculous. 

I got my second one earlier this month, only side effect was a dead arm and now I can’t stop telling people I’m vaccinated.

""Doctors"" is a pretty general term btw and IME most people who went to medical school feel confident expressing their opinion on all sorts of things far outside their specialization. There was, for instance, a time when most all pediatricians would tell you vegetarianism (god forbid veganism) was potentially ""dangerous"" despite the fact that nutrition is historically taught for less than a day in US med schools. A rather ironic dis to the Hippocratic oath's namesake who is believed to have said ""Let food be thy medicine"" btw....

Point being yes for sure, confirm things and the right doctor is a perfect authority to do so. But in the case of longhaul COVID which the medical establishment is only still learning about, do make sure its one you feel has a comfortable amount of humility about what they don't know and says as much, making clear the difference, to you between when they're stating and when they're speculating.",panu8w,ha6wd7i,boredtxan,2

Not saying it’s normal or is 100% harmless, but it’s also something many, many of us have had to go through. Now, like the other poster said, for some people it has resulted in GBS, but for the vast majority of us it hasn’t gotten worse than just the pins and needles or slightly numb feelings. 

I’m 5ish months out and still experiencing it from time to time. Others only had 2-3 days of it or 2-3 weeks of it...no ones really sure why. Just stay calm and listen to your body. I never experienced weakness or loss of mobility, and it seems like that’s the main differentiator. If you notice that, definitely time to get it checked out.

It's obvious at this point that it's not going to be easy. Even just the worry and anxiety is no joke, those might send your blood pressure so high you may end up in trouble just for that. You have to make a conscious effort at keeping your thoughts in check, and then decide to take or not the vaccine based on your rational assessment and not on an emotional basis.

Once you decide, stick with your decision and don't question it after the shot. If serious stuff comes up, you contact your doctor.

The following day I had some fatigue and just laid around the house all day.  My arm was sore, but no more sore than from any other vaccine. I was perfectly fine by evening.  

I had my second shot on 1/28/2021.  I was fine that whole evening:  no fever, fatigue, etc.  I took Tylenol before bed, just in case I tried to develop a fever overnight.  I was also fine the next morning (again, a sore arm, but that’s normal for an IM injection).  I went to work, but by 10 am or so (about 20 hours post-injection) I started getting chills.  That was followed by body aches.  I had a mild fever, but it wasn’t enough for me to have to go home from work or not do my duties.  

Chills, body aches, fatigue, and mild fever persisted for the evening.  I laid around and watched TV and took Tylenol every 4-6 hours.  I went to bed, and woke up in the middle of the night feeling very warm.  My temp had gotten up to 103°F.  I drank a cold drink and went back to sleep.  I woke up again at 4 AM and all of my symptoms were completely gone:  no aches, no fever, no chills, no fatigue.  It was like it had never happened.  All in all, my symptoms lasted about 16 hours from start to finish, and I was perfectly fine.

Background info:  I was 35 at the time of my injections.  I do have some underlying conditions like type 2 diabetes (not insulin dependent), and high blood pressure.  I’m a woman and have PCOS and stay on hormones which keep me from menstruating most of the time.  I’ve only had one menstrual period since being vaccinated, but that’s normal for me.  I have not had any new health problems crop up since being vaccinated.

I had a panic attack immediately after my shot, when I was in the waiting/monitoring section for 15 minutes. I had more panic attacks whenever I remembered I got the vaccine for the next 3 days, convinced I made the wrong decision and that I was going to drop dead (I did not, in fact, drop dead).

My side effects: Sore arm for 24 hours, a slight sore throat the night after the vaccine, as well as some neck pain. I did have chest pain, but I'm convinced it was in my head, because it flared up whenever I thought about it, and I went in with the fear of myocarditis, even though I'm not in the demographic that gets it (20s F). My heart rate stayed literally below 60 bpm for the 3 rest days I took, so I know logically that there was nothing wrong with my heart. Overall, I think I had it pretty good, considering I really only had non-anxiety side effects for about 24 hours and even those were relatively minor. 

Oh, and if you do opt for the vaccine, take a warm shower and try to keep your vaccinated arm under the running water the whole time. That helps A LOT. I had arm pain for 24 hours while my fiance had a sore arm for about a week.",paelvv,paelvv,Princess_Optimist,1

ha9g43n,1629872351.0,steviolol,"I can’t talk to Pfizer, as I just had AZ today. I have massive health anxiety, debilitating at times, and the thought of choosing to risk my health was tough, as in Australia we have a false sense of “I won’t get COVID” due to stupid decisions to chase COVID zero cases, so it really did feel like risking my health on purpose.

Ultimately for me, I’m not antivax so that was not why I put it off. I have a wife and we both work and we have a four year old.

I had to decide if I wanted to get a vaccine and almost definitely be fine, risk (likely) getting COVID and possibly getting really sick, or pray that my country (australia) doesn’t impose rules on unvaccinated people.

The last wasn’t an option, as with jobs and a kid we have struggled to give our 4 year old the fun she deserves with over 200 days in full on lockdowns, and our jobs and probably places you want to visit will likely require vaccination at some point.

So then I’m left with vax or COVID, as I am a believer that 18 months on - you are going to get COVID at some point with delta etc spreading.

This brings me to today, where I got my first AZ jab, yes I had what I’d call a 7/10 panic attack for about an hour during and after getting it, but now I’m feeling fine, sure I’ll probably get a little sick later on (maybe not?) but definitely found weighing the choices up like that was a huge help.",paelvv,paelvv,Princess_Optimist,1

I am pretty sure many of the negative vaccine stories are either overblown or caused by severe anxiety from the vax. Anxiety is a serious mental illness that causes your body to do all sorts of weird things. Someone here said he got pins and needles after his vax. That is anxiety, the worst symptom of it. I have those symptoms whenever I'm panicking or in an extremely stressful situation.

I had two shots of Moderna.  The first one was nothing! My flu shot was worse!

The second hit hard.  I had the ""covid arm reaction"" (large rash from elbow to shoulder), and EVERYTHING HURT for about a day and a half.  Wearing clothes hurt.  Laying in bed hurt, moving hurt.  I was able to arrange a schedule that worked with this though so I didn't have to worry about doing anything until after the reactions were over.

So I had a pretty bad time with the second one.  

My mother, her heart doctor, and my heart rate were all quite elevated for a little while after the shot but an elevated heart rate is a **NATURAL REACTION** to the body fending off illness, which is what it thinks it's doing with the shot.

SO I won't tell you nothing even happened to me, but it WAS over by day 3.  I think Moderna is more ""reactive"" than Pfizer or J&J from what I've seen.  I know of a whole business FULL of people who were vaccinated and NONE have had any long term crazy debilitating effects from it.

I’ve gotten much bette overall, but when whatever that is happening to me flares up, it’s like being in hell with anxiety, tingling, headaches, dizziness, vertigo, my breathing gets super deep and slow, but nothing that really triggers me as to why it comes. Mentally, aside from feeling annoyed and angry, I’m not really scared about anything. 

I’ll try the antihistamine diet to see if that helps me. It’ll probably be just time unfortunately until I’m back to my pre-vaccine self, in which I’ve never had these issues before in my entire 34 years of life",pad3c8,pad3c8,Competitive-Pea-339,1

Crazy how similar a lot of our reactions are! I’m a little over 5 months out and I still get the “buzzing” in my legs and sometimes in my pinky/ring finger areas. My legs/feet (especially left) kinda sometimes just feel...soft? Lol...no idea how to describe it. Not totally numb...just...softer. And yeah, the buzzing sometimes drives me crazy.

I’ll get 2-3 weeks of 100% normalcy and then the nerve stuff will pop back up. Like you, probably due to diet more than anything. Alcohol triggers it for sure (yay), and I’m sure certain kinds of foods too.

Did you try any supplements or anything medicinal (besides the acupuncture) that helped or hindered?

Can you explain a bit more about the acupuncture and what they did? I’ve never gone, but have thought about as I hear more and more people turning to that for these problems.

For what it’s worth, 1000% not trying to convince you to go a different route (trust me, I’m right there with you regarding the second dose), but all of this was via Pfizer for me. But I’ve seen plenty of people from J&J as well complain of the same problems...just seems like we’re all reacting in our own ways...some common, some uncommon. Pfizer could treat you way better than it did me...I’m also hoping Novovax becomes available in the near future.

I started to excercise again and I'm slowly starting to work again hence working with screens is soooo hard right now due to my newly-developed light sensitivity but I'm getting there. To add even more pressure, doctors even found out that I have a somewhat severe Astigmatism in both eyes but that's most likely not because of the the vaccine hahaha.

Anyway! It messed me up good but I'm doing slowly better, I hope it doesn't stay that way and I hope I recover and can be my old self again though I don't want to discourage or scare you! That was just my experience as an usually healthy 21 y.o male.",pa9pm4,pa9pm4,southiest,1

To me, this isn't a very surprising comment on the topic.

I've seen enough people pass away from COVID and met enough long-haulers (my friend who I just spent the weekend with is still experiencing symptoms 6+ months later. He wasn't himself. He has anxiety for the first time in his life, fatigue, migraines, and brain fog), that I don't want to take the risk.

BioNtech started work on the vaccine in January 2020.   IN Germany their government is good about funding their scientists.   Thankfully someone saw it coming while we were still in the weeds about it back then.  they saw it.

BioNtech vaccine was not part of operation warpspeed, by the way.  Those 2 turkish scientists are German citizens.

the reason why other vaccines take longer is because finding volunteeers for clincial trials.  In this case a LOT of poeple stepped up very quickly

I won't tell anyone who's scared of the vaccine that they're crazy; it's natural to be scared of this kind of stuff. But I ask that anyone who hasn't taken the vaccine to consider two points:

Masks are like ballistic shields, they protect you from getting shot in the first place.  Once you take the mask off or put the shield down, the only thing protecting you is your vaccine/bullet proof vest.

ha27p53,1629742475.0,Claudio6314,"- the covid vaccine reduces the number of infections in vaccinated individuals. The lowest value for reduction is 30-40% at present. The highest value is around 85%. 

- the covid vaccine reduces the severity of symptoms once infected. Hospitalizations among vaccinated are around 90-95% lower. 

- hospitals are limited. At some point they can fill up. More unvaccinated means more people overwhelming the medical infrastructure. 

- How do you not understand how people are still catching covid? It was explicitly reported in the phase III trial results before the delta variant was even identified that breakthrough cases happen... as with any vaccine. Efficacy was never 100%. 

Ultimately, at the individual level it's mostly irrelevant if you get the jab. Can you, at 25, die from covid? Sure. Is it likely? No. 

But if neither you nor any of your friends get the vaccine, then it becomes more problematic. We start having more cases of severe infection requiring hospitalization. That is the concern with the virus. Not saving some random granny or yourself. 

So if the only incentive for you is peer-pressure, then just tell your friends your uncomfortable with it and if they have an issue with that then so be it. I'm fully vaxxed but I still hang out with unvaxxed people. Frankly idgaf one way or another.",p9ufb0,p9ufb0,,1

ha1cjpy,1629729584.0,MastroRace,">	My mind basically says ""When vaccinated you can still catch covid, you can still transmit covid, you can still potentially die from covid.

Yes, you can still catch COVID, but your immune response is greatly more effective, which means you are less likely to experience symptoms and even less likely to die from infection.

As for transmission rate, it actually is lowered by the vaccine, since the window of time you’re infected is dramatically smaller, so chances are lower. [This](https://reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/p9bu8l/_/h9wp00z/?context=1) covers it in more detail if you’re curious.

In short, the vaccine is safe and you should get it. Remember to consult official sources though! Anybody can have an opinion but only sound science should be trusted. [Here’s](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html) somewhere to start. Hope this helps :)

Edited to add: first dose has been shown not to be effective against the delta variant, so it’s no surprise that with most people only vaccinated with single dose, cases are still high. Once most people are fully vaccinated we will see herd immunity.",p9ufb0,p9ufb0,,1

ha31wba,1629754847.0,Kingsdaughter613,"When vaccinated you can still catch ANY disease. And do. All the time.

Vaccines protecting you from getting infected is a myth. They don’t. They never have. And I really wish doctors would have clarified that years ago, instead of just letting people believe it because it was easier.

What vaccines do do use cause you to get better so fast that you never realize you have symptoms. This can also prevent you from becoming infectious, because you get better before you reach that stage. 

If enough people have a vaccine, then a virus cannot gain a foothold because nearly everyone who gets infected recovers before becoming infectious. The handful of people who do become infectious don’t have anyone to transmit to that would allow a virus to gain a foothold. If this goes on long enough, the virus dies out.

How much of the population needs to be vaccinated for this effect to occur varies. For example, the CDC say (IIRC) that 75% to 80% need to be vaccinated against Measles for herd immunity. In NYC, the actual number is 120% - or more than the actual population. This is due to population density. 

So… Covid vaccines. To start with, Covid vaccines were developed for the Alpha variant (I believe). So they don’t work as well against Delta, which they were not designed for. Specifically, they’re not great at preventing people infected with Delta from becoming infectious. They DO (mostly) prevent people with Delta from becoming seriously ill and enable them to recover faster. 

Obviously, there are exceptions. But there are always exceptions, and the number of vaccinated with severe Covid is much lower than, say, the number of vaccinated with severe smallpox. 

The reasons we have restrictions is because you can’t tell if someone is vaccinated or not from the street. Vaccine passports aren’t the worst solution for some places (because for most vaccinated getting infected isn’t an issue), but young children and the religious and medically exempt pose problems with those policies. Not to mention the fraudsters. It also puts the onus on many small businesses which may not have the capability to deal with enforcement of these bans.

The real concern is that the virus will mutate into something the vaccines won’t protect against at all. 

As for why Pfizer got FDA recognition so quickly? Honestly, the FDA takes an eternity to clear anything. Way longer than it should. There are people who have literally died waiting on FDA approval for perfectly safe technologies. I’m going to exaggerate a bit here to make the point (and because I learned the approval stages years ago and don’t want to look them up).

It shouldn’t take more than a year and a half to three years for the FDA to approve something in general. The reason it doesn’t is simple: the first five to ten years don’t do human testing. They test on animals extensively. THEN they get limited trials of small groups. Then slightly bigger ones. And so on. It takes forever. And if someone gets hit by a bus in the middle, you have to stop and check to ensure that it had nothing to with what you were testing. (And now you know why medicine costs so much…)

The emergency meant Pfizer got to skip to mass human trials very quickly. So a good chunk of the non-human testing got skipped, and the multiple small studies got skipped. So, since all the things that make approval take forever got bypassed, they were able to get clearance much faster.

Imagine where we’d be on other treatments if everyone with late stage fatal diseases could opt in to try an experimental treatment instead of hospice/end of life care? Why the FDA doesn’t let people do this is beyond me. The number of people trying to get into trials would indicate this is an option people want. But the FDA likes to keep tight control on testing, which is why so many perfectly good medications never get FDA approval. 

And even then, they can always find an issue thirty years down the line. (Yes, that happened once. More than once, actually. The Pill, for example, could never be approved today for common use because it can cause depression as a common side effect. You probably know someone who has taken it though.)

You seem to know this already, but be weary of the source of any info you get online. I have found info from credentialed medical experts with valid conerns, but I have found a lot more things that sound like the writer is fresh out of Arkham Asylum. 

I can tell you about my experience. I had AZ a few months ago. Thankfully it was the one I prefered as the mRNA shots are based on very new technolgy. The viral vector technology used in AZ, while still fairly new, has been successfully used in two effective Ebola vaccines, so has more data to back it. I wouldn't have turned down the Pfizer or Moderna, but if they were my only option, I would have waited until about now to get it so I could see how other people in my age group were handling it.

As for the jab itself, first shot wasn't great. I felt pretty quesy for a couple of days with a bit of a fever, and my arm was very sore for a week. Second shot was a breeze. Arm was tender for a few hours at most.

And word of mouth is bullshit.  honestly this entire pandemic has been politicized to no end and I dont trust anybody’s say so because of it. I personally would also take the numbers of unvaccinated people Currently in the hospital dying as a factor since as soon as Johnson and Johnson found eight people who had adverse side effects because of the vaccine they stopped using it for a while!  so if over 12,000,or however many they’re saying, have actually died from the vaccine, what evidence is there to say that they wouldn’t have said anything about it to the public?

I also have a science degree. I realize now that I was in “analysis paralysis” over it all. What made me decide to get it eventually was coming to terms with the fact that 1. Bad side effects are really rare (and are for sure magnified here) 2. I’ve never had any side effects from any vaccine I’ve taken before, including the yearly flu shot, so why should I think I would be one of the rare ones now? 3. Vaccines in general work (which I have always believed), and this vaccine has been shown to be pretty effective. The delta variant is a real threat currently, and I’ll be protecting myself and others from hospitalization/death by getting it. 

The other thing that made me bite the bullet and get it was honestly peer pressure. I was sick of having to avoid conversations about it or explain my hesitation to anyone who asked. Not a great reason to get it, but that combined with the other things made me jump in the water.

But if you're stressing like this then go get it over with. You usually can't maintain a state of indecisiveness for that long before you just go for it. So if this has been a prevalent thought for a long time, just get the jab. 

My symptoms were negligible. 

First shot was just sore arm. 3 days later I got drunk and had an elevated heart rate for about 3 days. Normal bpm is 55. After going out and drinking I maintained like 85 for 2 days and 70 for 1. Then back to normal. 

Second shot I had the sore arm. Went drinking two days later. No elevated heart rate. Worked out the day after that (weight lifting). No issues.

As somebody commented here, my decision was based on my circle my family, coworkers, and others, I haven’t heard of bad side effects or adverse events from the vaccine. I weighted the adverse reaction on the USA and Europe medical system and were very rare ( avg 1:1 million) although is always the case that could happen to you, the risk is around that number in confirmed data and other vaccines like mmr, hepB, influenza, etc have also similar side effects if you start looking at it. Published cases in medical journals were not that common to find. If it were something not rare much more publicized information will be around.

ha0i4dk,1629711424.0,,"As someone who had a very recent covid infection, the vaccine should be contraindicated, IMO. You have immunity. 

These vaccines do have side effects. Adverse events rates are highest following the second dose or the first dose in those with antibodies from infection. Modera has higher adverse events then Pfizer likely because it’s a stronger dose. If I were you I would not accept a Modera vaccine.

The introduction of S-protein in the presence of antibodies correlates with adverse effects, a classic inflammatory response. We know severe COVID disease is an inflammatory and clotting disorder caused by viral proteins. 


The S1 manufactured by your body through the vaccine can have a similar pathology. Similarities in COVID / long-haul and vaccine side effects are fairly clear at this point from a casual review of the data and anecdotes, as you have done.

It sounds like the reason you are considering vaccination is out of social pressure, which is overwhelming. This was largely orchestrated to maximize vaccine uptake to reach herd immunity ASAP. With these vaccines and more infectious variants, this isn’t going to happen. Fools errand. So don’t feel guilty and pressured for this reason.  

As someone with natural immunity, you could get double vaccinated with Moderna and be totally fine. I’m sure many people have. Quantifying risk is difficult. The only data we have is self report systems like VAERS. The adverse event rate is something on the order of 1:1000. It could be much higher, especially in Modera and in those with natural immunity.

So what’s the medical risk vs benefit? In your case, it’s clear. You stand to gain little to no benefit by accepting the vaccine. Quantifying risk is therefore irrelevant with a zero in the denominator. 

The reason you would vaccinate is entirely out of social pressure and coercion. That’s a very personal decision. We all have different tolerances for pressure and coercion.

Here are the facts in my little book

* I do not know anyone who has been effected negatively by any of the vaccines.
* As far as I know no one in my workplace 100+ people has been negatively effected or died.
* I have found some news articles showing me that mistakes in administering the vaccines could have been reasons for some of the bad effects, including blood clots or them not working. This is not being covered by the press, I am guessing, because they don't want to discourage health care workers... who probably put in long hours, but I never thought those mass vaccination sites made any sense and were rife to have errors.
* In order to get the Emergency use authorization all deaths after vaccination were required to be reported to VERS... a normal vaccine only reports deaths they believe were caused by the vaccine. Thus necessary VERS deaths are going to be way higher.  An example of a death that occurred after the vaccine that sounds scary is a woman died of liver failure after getting the vaccine but she took too much Tylenol.

I've heard stories from people online as well as people I know who say they knew someone who died mysteriously after given the shot. My father's classmate was incredibly healthy for his age, ran marathons, but 2 weeks after getting the shot, had a heart attack and died. There was also another member of this sub where her mother got a heart attack after the vaccine, and almost passed away.

I think that we probably haven't heard about it so much because like other people have said, this pandemic has been so political and it's also about money. You saw what happened to AZ when they started having people with blood clots--it was pulled for a while. Do you think other companies want to see that happen to them, making them lose millions of dollars? Plus, do you think that people wouldn't be in an uproar if they found out the ""miracle vaccine"" could kill you?

1. Directly by increasing the risk of harm to the mother and baby, https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01798-1

2. Overburdening the healthcare system leading to delays or lack of access to care.  I don't know what area you are in but here in my part of Texas our ICUs (adult and pediatric) are full and our hosptials have less than 10% beds remaining.  I was healthy through out my pregnancy and we went into birth expecting no problems.  I ended up with an emergency c-section anyway.

Or because they're morons.  Of which there are plenty of docs that are morons- trust me, I'm saying this as an insider. 

Intubating is not an answer to COVID.  As a matter of fact, it can worsen it.  Intubate for a disordered control of breathing?  Sure.   That's not what COVID is, however.  You need to treat the underlying pathophys, and if they're so far into respiratory distress that they're on the verge of failure - OK, fine, go ahead and tube.  But intubation is a last ditch effort to stave off complete respiratory failure and not some cure all.  Therapeutics are the way.

Given the sheer number of people vaccinated (4.91 billion vaccine doses world wide!) vs. those that have gotten COVID, it seems that long-term COVID effects are more likely than long-term adverse vaccine side effects. 

Anecdotally, I know someone who has terminal cancer who will be on chemo for the rest of her life who got vaccinated. I have friends who have diagnosed autoimmune and neurological disorders who have been vaccinated. All without lasting side effects. I personally know of at least 20 deaths from COVID within my circle of friends ad acquaintances, and no one who has been vaccine injured. 

You write, ""I feel like there is much more potential for covid to become as mainstream as the flu. Wouldn't then make more sense to follow regular sanitary guidlines, wearing masks and being careful about your contact with others during times of peak infection than vaccinating everybody regardless of their health status?"" 

It makes sense to continue following guidelines and to still be vaccinated. My understanding is that COVID will hopefully eventually mutate to become the flu, but it will be causing a lot of death and harm to our unvaccinated population (and a few vaccinated!) as it takes this course. Your decision is not just affecting you personally. Not getting vaccinated is having real world consequences, as we are seeing in Florida and other low-vaccinated states in the US. You are more likely to catch COVID if you are unvaccinated, and you are more likely to transmit it.\* This means you could be injuring someone. (For example, my mother is vaccinated, and she is also 80, and I worry that a breakthrough infection would adversely affect the quality of the remainder of her life). You also do not know if you will develop long haul symptoms, or you will be hospitalized or not from getting COVID, even at your age. This virus is unpredictable. But if you are hospitalized, you are potentially burdening the healthcare system and taking time and resources away from someone who needs it by declining a free, preventable measure that has been demonstrated to be safe. Go take a look at the top posts from r/medicine, and read about doctors' empathy fatigue when their ICUs are overwhelmed with unvaccinated patients. Look at the numbers of how many ICU doctors are vaccinated -- 94%. 

I understand the fear of side effects, I really do. I had COVID in March 2020, and I took both doses of the vaccine knowing that I would probably suffer from significant side effects, as I knew that those with a prior infection had a rough time. It was scary, and not fun. I also knew those adverse symptoms would most likely be temporary (they were!), and I was making the right decision to protect myself and others. By comparison, my symptoms from COVID were much more extreme, even with a mild case without hospitalization. I lost toenails, had emotional disturbances, was fatigued with brain fog for weeks, and it was scary losing sense of smell and taste, and not knowing it would return.

In general, if you’re coming up with criteria that are impossible to meet, even in the face of both clinical trials that involved tens of thousands of people and massive real-world studies in many countries, you should ask yourself if you’re really just looking for reasons not to get the vaccine.",p9da9y,p9da9y,,1

I suspect that this will not go over well in this sub, but public health is kinda callous in the sense that something is deemed safe it's not substantially altering the probability of an adverse event happening in the first place. The frequency of adverse events can not be viewed in isolation. Take blood clots, for example, the risk of getting a blood clot in a year is about 0.1%. The estimated risk of a blood clot from the vaccine is 0.0003%. For people ending up in the ICU with COVID, the risk of a blood clot is about 20%.

I decided the chance of experiencing long Covid was something I wasn’t interested in dealing with over any vaccine side effects. So I got vaccinated. 

Also I like to travel, other countries don’t give a shit about my personal freedoms here in America. If I have to be vaccinated to travel the world, so be it. It’s literally trading one freedom for other. It’s all stupid getting our head wrapped up in ego over a life saving vaccine.",p9c04g,p9c04g,,1
h9wml5v,1629638225.0,shillyshally,"Two good reasons. 

One, being vaccinated keeps you out of the hospital and off a ventilator. 99% of those who have died after the vaccines became available have eschewed vaccination.

Secondly, hospital beds are filling up with covid patients. I have family in one of the state's with a poor vac record. A family friend had a heart attack recently and was turned away from the hospital and had to go to the next county as there were no beds available at all.

So, do it for yourself and do it for others.",p9c04g,p9c04g,,1
h9wp8if,1629639648.0,TomCruisintheUSA,"Only 1 person that I've known who caught covid has gone on a ventilator and that was my father. He's in his early 60s and has been a drug addict for over 20yrs, even he came out within a week with no issues. 

My wife just had minor cosmetic surgery at the largest hospital in my area and it was almost empty, that was 25 days ago and I live in Southern Tennessee. I highly doubt if the hospitals are overflowing with covid when I can pay $2500 for a cosmetic surgery and book a hospital bed within 2 weeks. 

The news and my personal experiences with covid seem to be 2 different scenarios, and again I'm not denying or rejecting covid at all but my experience with it so far has been very minor. I've known 1 person to die from covid and they were in their upper 80s.

People keep saying that it prevents/shortens the experience but from knowing people who have caught covid with the vaxx has shown the opposite. They were just as sick the 2nd time as the 1st",p9c04g,h9wml5v,shillyshally,2
h9x0vl6,1629645123.0,moloves,"Wether or not to take the vaccine is a mitigated risk. 


My husband was hospitalized with severe COVID in November 2020. The doctor said he would do everything he could to keep him out the ICU. The doctor said Covid is unpredictable and we just don’t know who will end up in the ICU or die. 


My sister live in Westchester County NY. She has known 21 people to die from Covid prior to the vaccine rollout. Since the vaccine rollout no one she knows who caught Covid, fully vaccinated, has died. 


The other part is the risk to others. If more people were vaccinated varieties like delta would be less likely to produce. I felt it my responsibility to try and protect others.",p9c04g,p9c04g,,1

For the covid vaccine the mRNA puce basically makes some of your cells cosplay that they are infected by the virus. I suspect this causes a stronger immune response resulting in more people experiencing side effects.

If you don't have symptoms it means nothing... think about how much variability people have with illness. One person in a household will sleep off a cold in 24hrs while another is feeling bad for a week.

h9swtwv,1629562411.0,Bbonline1234,"Holy fuck. 

Your symptoms match exactly what happened to me after my vaccine back in February/March.

I workout everyday, do tons do cardio, vegan diet, drink lots of water. Rarely have alcohol, and never smoke. Basically very clean life. 

I’ve never had an anxiety/panic attack in my life, 34M, nor am scared of needles. I was looking forward to my vaccine. 

I had no immediate reaction to the vaccine, either first or 2nd dose.

A week after my 2nd Pfizer dose, I had take a small amount of preworkout, something I’ve done for many years, and while I was waiting for it to kick in and just browsing on my computer, my heart rate shot up to 175bpm, I felt out of breathe, dizzy, and felt like I was going to collapse. My breathing was slow. Mentally I was not worried other than wondering what’s going on. This feeling off would last 6-10+ hours. 

My heart settled down on my way to the ER where they checked me out and found nothing wrong. I was released a couple hours later. About 10 hours after that first “attack” I was sitting on my couch watching a show and eating dinner, where another attack happened, heart rate up to 160+bpm, felt dizzy. 

The next morning after I woke, another attacked happened just laying in bed reading Reddit. 

Over the course of the next week multiple attacks throughout the day.

Then a week later i started to get clammy hands, body shivering, headaches, vertigo, and GI issues added to my list of symptoms. 

This has been going on since early March. My endurance/stamina is gone, im tired more often, my sex drive is gone and I don’t have morning wood anymore. It’s gotten better but about 2-3 times a week I still have a mild version of the attacks. My quality of life at the moment is extremely lower than before the vaccine. 

Like you, initially they told me it was stress/anxiety. But I’m being 100% honest when I say that I’m not worried or anxious about anything at the moment that would suddenly cause me to have day long attacks.

Ive been seeing a cardiologists, 4 psychiatrists, my pcp and they all at a loss as to what is going on. They’re started to agree it’s not anxiety/stress related because of the duration of the attacks and that they’re seeing other people with similar symptoms to the vaccine.

You panic, your heart rate increases, you can have heart palpitations, muscle pain, etc. because that anxiety can cause physical symptoms. Myself, and others I know with anxiety, have had periods of time where that panic essentially doesn’t go away from days to months at a time. It is really terrifying when you first experience it but as long as your tests are coming back normal then that’s likely all it is.

Because shingles is dormant varicella zoster, any actual infection or immune response (getting all ramped up to FIGHT THE INVADERS! even if there are none) can trigger a shingles outbreak.

Unfortunately those of us who had chickenpox when we were younger might face this later on down the line. At present though it's my understanding that if you get shingles at any point prior to the typical recommended date for Shingrix, you can get Shingrix with a prescription. Shingrix also has a pretty strong systemic response, similar to vaccines against covid.

This is kinda in line with me getting a cold sore after I got vaccinated- but it also happens when I get sick or stressed. Stinking dormant viruses!

Without a doubt, shingles is preferable to Covid-19, especially at her age. But she could have easily gotten it soon regardless. Nasty stuff.

for some reason the WHO and the U.S. CDC dragged their feet on admitting that and insisted the opposite for over a year, and finally quietly updated their guidance earlier this year without making any attempt to reeducate people so they don’t continue to think that just sanitizing surfaces and using plexiglass barriers really does anything (the latter of which might actually make things worse, apparently)

there are some really good diagrams in this twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/jljcolorado/status/1376291749975441418) about airborne spread if you’re interested. i thought the one in tweet 7 was particularly interesting.",p875xo,p875xo,bufffrog,1
h9r7it6,1629521819.0,waterisaliquid93,"Also a lot of people have this misconception and I’ve pointed it out to a few people on COVID subreddits before. People still seem to think surfaces are a significant vector for transmission when they really aren’t.  Even according to the CDC, surface transmission likely accounts for spread in less than 1 in 10,000 cases. Viruses need hosts. Without a host they die off quickly. 

Sure sanitizing surfaces And hands is definitely necessary.. there are tons of other bacteria and pathogens that DO spread through surfaces, but relying only on sanitizing surfaces or going overboard (sanitizing Amazon packages before opening) just puts public health in danger and is a waste of time.

Also correct me if I’m wrong, but a lot of it has to do with air circulation. You are way less likely to contract COVID in an outdoor space because air is on constantly being circulated by wind. Indoors, you’re breathing  the same stuffy air for hours unless your building/home has state of the art ventilation that is constantly filtering and replacing the air like in an airplane or train. 

The benefit of air travel compared to car / bus is that the cabin air is refreshed every ~3 minutes. This means potentially virus filled air is filtered back into the plane and deactivated by HEPA filters. Air filtration is absolutely necessary for pressurized aircraft, and to help protect passengers from harmful vapors and pollutants.

In many however, past that point it is not uncommon for immunity to wane.

I got my 1st dose and around 12 hours later I started to get a pain in the left side of my stomach, what felt like my kidney area. It wasn't any excruciating pain, it was more like I would a slight shooting pain every now and then. 

It kept happening over the next few days so I scheduled an appointment with a doctor. The doctor told me that the pain I was feeling was where something in the vaccine (sorry I can't remember the exact term he said) had attached to lymph nodes down near my kidneys and they had swollen slightly. For some people it attaches under the armpit hence you'll see some people saying they have lumps in their armpit for a while after the vaccine. The pain went away completely after maybe 2 - 3 weeks. I was worried about getting my 2nd dose and having the same pain but I had no pain whatsoever after the second dose. I felt like shit that evening (flu like symptoms) but by the following evening I was back to 100% again.

h9ltix1,1629421374.0,nevemarin,"I think it’s because sometimes vaccines give you the symptoms of the virus you’re being vaccinated against. Kind of like how shingles is hell, and the shingles vaccine is also really rough. Covid is a serious virus with weird and horribly unpleasant symptoms for some of us, and your reaction to the vaccine can also be intense. It’s inflammation, so do whatever you can to reduce inflammation. Also, just bc the first one is like this doesn’t mean the second one will be. My first shot reaction was not pleasant (I had symptoms like yours, and other ones). The second one was totally fine. 

The spike protein isn’t getting into places it shouldn’t. Your body eliminates all of it, it’s not getting into your nerves. What happens is byproducts of inflammation get over a certain threshold and receptors in your nervous system pick them up and start sending signals around. When the inflammation calms down, so will they.

Here’s the latest weekly update at the time of writing:
https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/COVID-19/safety-report-22.asp
Note that they had given 1.92M doses by the report date, but most people have had 2 doses, so you’re looking at the reports they’ll admit to of those who chose to write in to complain of probably 1.1M people.

You’ll see on this report they’re sharing that they’ve had 22 reports of deaths, 20 people developed deep vein thrombosis, 18 strokes, 7 heart attacks…

But independent researchers uncovered 80 deaths out of the ~1.1M participants, all documented.
https://suegrey.co.nz/index.php/2021/08/19/formal-for-affidavit-to-report-post-jab-deaths/

So… almost certainly an under report of everything.

Don’t be gaslit. Doctors are under huge pressure here not to reveal that they can see that international trends suggest that Pfizer is nowhere near as effective as it was sold as and also that the risks may be on par with covid. Hopefully you find a friend in the health system who will do their best within the parameters they’ve been given to offer you good advice. In any case, you’re not alone.

Eg. Of demonising doctors who politely voice their concerns to a patient. Normally, when there’s something that can’t be proven by medical science you go to multiple experts to get a “second opinion”.  Why do second opinions exist? Because we recognise that on many things we don’t have good data and therefore even the experts can disagree . Unfortunately, politics and media babble seems to have overtaken our concern for due diligence and normal health science, here.

Basically, those with mRNA injected spike proteins ended up getting covid still and thus the virus being a pretty smart pathogen, adapted within those people who had gotten infected with spike proteins already in there system creating a more resistant mutation.

Of these, 2579 had COVID in the past and 1359 of those remained unvaccinated for the duration of the study. Unvaccinated was defined as everyone who didn't get 2 doses of an mRNA less than 14 days before the study concluded. During the study period, none of the previously infected participants who got re-infected remained un-vaccinated.

Three interesting things to note here;

1. There *were* re-infections among the previously infected, but none of them remained unvaccinated for the duration of the study. It's entirely plausible that the people who got COVID for the second time said ""f\*\*\* this, I'm getting the vaccine"".
2. People who got J&J, or only one dose of Moderna/Pfizer counted as unvaccinated.
3. The study was performed before delta, and it's noted in the conclusions that these results may change if new variants become prevalent.

The conclusion of the study was that if vaccine supply is limited, it might be better to prioritize the people who didn't already have COVID. Nowhere in the paper does it state that they don't need the vaccine.

h9hrq6e,1629345491.0,Trip-trader,"Read this.  Explains some good information on the subject and breakdown of the risks vs the benefits.

“Bell’s palsy is the sudden onset of one-sided facial paralysis, and in the majority of cases (70 per cent) the condition resolves itself within six months without treatment.  The chance of recovery is even higher (90 per cent) if patients receive early treatment with corticosteroids.”

“The study found that receiving CoronaVac was associated with 2.4 times increased risk of Bell’s palsy, whereas the Pfizer jab was not associated with a significantly increased risk.”

So get Pfizer if your worried about this. But yes it’s a risk and some very rare cases have been triggered by Pfizer too.  

Now if you catch Covid your risk is orders of magnitude larger for you having blood clots, myocarditis or the Covid symptoms that can kill you.  Covid has possibly been linked with brain changes too in some cases, possibly explaining some of the long Covid symptoms.

Nothing us risk free but Covid risk far out weighs the very small risks from the vaccines.  Hope this helps.  Keep reading up on not just the risk of the vaccines but the risk if you catch Covid.

h9g8itu,1629319041.0,lannister80,">How long do the spike proteins contained in the vaccine stay in the body after vaccination?

A few days, then they're all destroyed by the immune system.

>Is there any chance that the spike proteins can escape the site of injection and travel to other parts of the body, potentially causing harm?

Yes, some tiny percentage of the cells with protruding spike proteins leave the arm muscle and end up in the liver.  

No, they cannot cause damage because they are stuck in a ""prefusion"" configuration which means if they attach to an ACE2 receptor somewhere, nothing happens.

>Does the vaccine teach the body to replicate those spike proteins, or simply to make antibodies to destroy them? 

The vaccine contains instructions for your body to make the spike protein.  However, the instructions (mRNA) are fragile and disintegrate within a few days.  When the mRNA is gone, you body can no longer make spike proteins.

Your body notices these spike proteins, says ""wtf?  These aren't ""us"", kill em!"", and then remembers how to kill them more quickly and efficiently in the future if you're exposed to the real virus.

>Is there any potential for long-term side effects from this vaccine?

But it can definitely be anxiety — your body can sometimes just behave as though it’s in shock and your conscious mind has no correlation as to why (same thing happens when people pass out during routine needles, etc, and they have no conscious problem with it).  

Magnesium, muscle relaxants like robaxin/methocarbomal, sometimes a proton pump inhibitor for your stomach can help. Relora is a good supplement to calm your nervous system down as well. Stuff that calms down your nervous system and reduces inflammation is key.

We let it run its course and moved on with life. Imo. I dont see a need for the vaccine. Atleast for me and my family. We've already had it and see no need. Majority of my kids are at the age to where they understand viruses and vaccines and we've given them the choice to get the jab or not. They refuse it.

L Citrulline, some in morning some at night. (it says it affects blood pressure but doesn't seem to affect mine too much)

Melatonin before bed (not for sleeping, for heart/inflammation)

h9e0a8i,1629275913.0,sweethun45,"1. Unfortunately this is true for all manufacturers. Bringing a process to comply with GMP standards is challenging and companies with no previous experience with mRNA vaccine manufacturing may encounter issues. However regulators may also be more ""relaxed"" due to the emergency situation. Moreover, similar to gene and cell therapy products, there are not established standards and the regulation evolves  along with the product. All those who said the technology has been around for X amount of years are correct, but that is for the RnD side. Process development and production/quality control is a whole different world (this comes from a person with experience with CTA and BLA submissions). 

2. There are some Phase I/II trials with other mRNA vaccines but they are either still running or have been used for other purposes (for cancer treatment). Yes the technology has been around for some time now but this is the first time it has been done in humans in such a large scale.
https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/horizon-magazine/five-things-you-need-know-about-mrna-vaccine-safety
I do think the technology is very promising and can save time and money during manufacturing. However the target, in this case the spike protein, has shown to have some pathogenic effects in animal models. Moreover there have been reports on the risk of ADE with SARS when using the S protein as target  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/?report=reader
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7075522/?report=reader
 These are just a few studies but I think is something that has to be taken into account.

3. Only time and more data will tell which population are at risk of developing these and other side effects and whether these will have long-term consequences. Of course we know Covid has awful consequences so taking the vaccine should be done after a thorough risk assessment. 

4. Again this is a true concern and nobody can't argue against it. Only time will tell how safe these vaccines are long term. I have also seen people's criticism of VAERS but it blows my mind how pharmacovigilance has been so horribly handled. This is really concerning. 

5. That is something that will keep happening as the virus will continue to evolve. Other measures apart from vaccines have to be implemented, starting with proper protocols to treat people who unfortunately catch the virus.

I also hate taking medications. I give a lot of medications all day long and I rarely take more than an ibuprofen myself (unless i have an infection and need abx, for example.) However, the vaccine is different to me. This is a preventative measure to give yourself the best chance to fight a very contagious, potentially deadly (or long term debilitating) virus. Of course, there are very few, but true documented reactions to these vaccines. In the same way some people are anaphylactically allergic to tylenol, or peanuts, of course not everything works for everybody. But for a very significant majority of folks the vaccine benefits FAR outweighs the risks. 

If you get covid? We also have no idea the years+ long term effects of that; however there are many ""long-haulers"" and those that are left with significant medical conditions after recovering - IF they survived. We do know it's an absolutely miserable virus to get, and die from. I did not work in the ICU but I had many, many covid patients crying, desperate with how terrible they felt - and they were lucky to be breathing on their own. I identify with feeling nervous about putting something into your body - but if you get sick and need hospitalization, the amount of strong meds you will need to sustain you is A LOT.  That's also if you get medical care - when the hospitals fill above capacity, there's no beds, no doctors, no nurses, no medicine, no ventilators.

I got mine in December/Jan (Pfizer) and I felt a bit of a backache after the second, otherwise totally fine. Some of my colleagues/friends/family felt run down for a few days, pretty normal as you induce that immune response.",p6cwh9,p6cwh9,,1

But he's almost certainly going to die and leave her in a mountain of debt, bankrupt and without her husband who brought in most of their income. Even if he beats all the odds and somehow survives, he will not recover for a long, long time and those bills will still be there with no way for him to work and pay them off.

I understand the hesitancy about putting new things in your body, but covid-19 is also a new thing that is almost guaranteed to eventually enter your body if you don't get vaccinated, and if you had to choose between taking the vaccine and taking the virus, the vaccine is already known to be the far, far healthier option.

They were not rushed.  No steps were skipped or shortened, they were simply done at the same time / in parallel because cost was no issue.

>The lack of data when it comes to the longterm side effects mRNA vaccines may have on the human body

We have data of these vaccines in the first trial participants in March 2020.  Many thousands of people since last summer (more than a year).  In vaccine world, that *is* long term.  FDA only requires 6 months of safety data for application for full approval.

In addition, the vaccine is gone from your system within 6 days. This isn't like some maintenance drug you take every day that could have consequences years down the line due to it affecting your body system on a daily basis.  It codes for a ""broken"" spike protein, body mounts an immune response, and then you're done.

>The possibility that the current vaccine may have little to no effect on the new variants and the possibility of needing to get a 3rd or more shots in the future.

That is not a possibility.  The vaccines are very effective for every known variant.  You're 8.3 times less likely to get infected at all with Delta if you're vaccinated.  You're very, *very* unlikely to end up in the hospital if you are infected.

>The theory that there may be hidden things about the vaccine such as possible longterm side effects or substances inside the shot that are unknown to the public and that the vaccine labs, FDA, CDC, WHO, and doctors may be aware about but concealing in order to get people to vaccinate and profit.

COVID is a dangerous disease, and you are very likely to be exposed to it at some point in your life, possibly even multiple times during your life, especially since it is seeming more and more unlikely that we will be able to ever eradicate it like we did Polio, due to widespread vaccine hesitancy like yours.

Long story short: There is nothing that can cause long-term side effects. And this is not only true for mRNA vaccines, but also for nearly every other vaccine.

I wanted to avoid covid's possible issues with brain damage. hopefully vaccines don't have long term issues as well.

I took a gamble, really. I was forced to pick a side, after going with no vaccine and no covid since the beginning. But now things are tightening up again. Covid may end up endemic like measles and mumps: at that point, would I really want to be the only one worried about it while eating out in 2025?

I'm also mildly concerned with Paracrine Senescence in the Endothelium. Senescence is when the cell decides to no longer proliferate/recreate itself. Paracrine Senescence is senescence that spreads from cell-to-cell in a structure, this structure being the endothelium in the case of COVID infections. I'm worried about the vaccine causing oxidative stress that would induce a similar reaction in the endothelium due to it spreading through the cardiovascular system. I'm not a biologist, virologist, or a doctor of any sort but it is a worry and I want to be wrong.

""A nonreplicable form of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is used in the vaccines for immunization. Therefore, viral spike protein expression and duration of antigenic stimulation to the immune system in the injected tissue (although expected for a brief period) may not be sufficient to exhibit significant senescence or deleterious effect to adjacent endothelial cells. In this scenario, senior or elderly people who already have an accumulation of senescent cells may have a higher possibility of paracrine senescence after vaccination""

This source is only on the coronavirus effects observed thus far: [https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JVI.00794-21](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JVI.00794-21)

It is to note that senotherapeutics are being developed and the journal also offers potential solutions to the observed senescent cells.

""Endothelial senescence may lead to microvascular complications by secretion of the cellular adhesion molecules VCAM-1/ICAM-1, which may cause leukocyte adhesion on the surface of the endothelium and may increase coronary blockade (30). The increased expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules has been noted in COVID-19 patients (31). Our study suggested that the use of tocilizumab and zanubrutinib reversed the senescence effect in endothelial cells, prevented VCAM-1/ICAM-1 expression, and reduced leukocyte attachment.""

Getting a vax is a personal decision but you HAVE to weigh the real benefits against the real deficits.  That doesn't mean listening tot he taking head on TV saying masks are tyranny, that means RELIABLE people in the medical community.

Now , for this:

>The fact that the Covid-19 vaccine is Moderna's first commercial product.

I didn't know this, and I get Moderna.  It is used for emergency authorization just like Pfizer and J&J.  It is safe and reliable, although I do say it's more ""reactive"" than Pfizer.

Also, it's getting tot he point where you don't HAVE to take Moderna, we're not in a huge rush anymore, and you can almost choose your vax.  


>The fact that mRNA technology is used for the first time in a human vaccine in a rushed way to get people vaccinated as soon as possible.

This is patently false, please stop calling this a fact.  mRNA is not rushed...it has been around for decades though maybe not used to this extent.

>The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, the risk is low but still present.

This is certainly a potential possibility and naturally, increased heartrate is a NATURAL effect of the body fighting off disease (which it's doing with the vax.)  But this has flat out been proven to improve with rest and relaxation.  It's important to RELAX the days after your shots so you can sort out and work through the  potential side effects.  This virus is hardhitting, it is NOT like the flu and the vaccine isn't like the flu shot either.

>The lack of data when it comes to the longterm side effects mRNA vaccines may have on the human body


There are none.  It does not affect your DNA.  it simply forces the body to recognize the proteins on the C19 pathogen. The chances of permanent problems are so infinitesimaly small that it's statistically bonkers not to take the potential protection over the concern for side effects.


>The possibility that the current vaccine may have little to no effect on the new variants and the possibility of needing to get a 3rd or more shots in the future.


98% of people in the hospital now for C19 are unvaxed.  it keeps you OUT of the hospital and eliminates the need to use resources on you that can be used for the next person that needs medical care through no fault of ther own.

Get the vax and STAY OUT of the hospitals.


>The theory that there may be hidden things about the vaccine such as possible longterm side effects or substances inside the shot that are unknown to the public and that the vaccine labs, FDA, CDC, WHO, and doctors may be aware about but concealing in order to get people to vaccinate and profit.

h9awobk,1629215214.0,transdermalcelebrity,"Same. They are expecting to file for EUA in Q4 of the year. My very general understanding is that they are good with the clinical trials portion of their application, but they need 3rd party action to complete the manufacturing portion (essentially confirming things like they can handle consistent and safe manufacturing... there are very specific reports and findings that need to be submitted). So some are expecting to see it around November-December. However they already have orders in other countries so I have no idea how many doses they will have for the US and which states will choose to buy it. 
 
I'm hoping that with all the battles over the other vaxes, this one will be seen as a safer compromise and that will encourage a lot more distribution in the US. You can check out [r/NVAX](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVAX/) to try and get more information. Note though, that's more of a sub for the investors so the comments are focused more on strategy and sometimes wishful thinking. However there are links to more recent articles like their CEO speaking of the current state. And I believe there is a petition floating around asking the FDA to do what they can to speed up the authorization process.

While I haven’t heard about any of these side effects other than blood clots I can tell you blood clots caused by medication is fairly common actually.

I have something very similar to long Covid (ME/CFS after mono in 1996). I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. It has ruined my career and life. Covid can and does kill young healthy people or debilitate them for an unknown amount of time. 

I was extensively exposed to someone recently who ended up having Covid. Like, hugging for minutes at a time (she was consoling me), talking within a couple feet of each other for hours and she ended up very sick and testing positive the next day (found out she was unvaccinated). I got a tiny bit of GI issues and a sniffly nose/ a few sneezes, a little weak and a mildly numb set of nostrils. Took two Covid rapid tests and they were both negative. 

My Pfizer vaccine quite possibly saved my life. I’ve had more than one doctor tell me Covid will likely kill me (before I had the vaccine. I have a blood clotting disorder, lupus, tons of autoimmune issues, on immune suppressants, overweight, diabetes, you name it). I even have a condition where my immune system makes too many proteins (antibodies) and something (we suspect these proteins) was starting to affect all my organs and I was having weird heart, kidney, lung, jaundice, neurological etc. issues and I was scared to death because the vaccine makes MORE of those antibodies and I STILL got the vaccine, because I knew it was better than the alternative. I have ME/CFS and a decent proportion of us have had bad flares lasting weeks or months after the vaccine and that made me scared, but you know what?  Dying or long-Covid or feeing like you are drowning because you can’t breathe is a lot worse than all those things. If I can get over my very real (and documented)fears, so can you. 

Vaccines are science. Science works. Unless you are a  scientist, you probably don’t know enough about how experimental or not they are (they aren’t). 

Do you not believe that 99% or so of deaths are amongst the unvaccinated?  Science speaks for itself. Please listen to the people who have gotten Covid when they were once hesitant to get vaccinated. So many have said (sometimes their final words), that they should have gotten it and plead for others to do so. I’m not trying to be mean or say that my fears are real and yours aren’t, but take a step back. What are the hard facts on what the vaccines have been doing to cause bad (almost exclusively minor and temporary side effects), versus the data that shows that literally everyone who is getting really sick or dying is unvaccinated, younger and healthier than the original COVID? Please, they’ve been working on this research (mRNA) for a decade, they just were using it for a different purpose (to fight cancer). Any crazy dangerous issues would show up in the first few months. It has been tested in this capacity for about a year. Don’t risk it. best of luck to you and let us know what you decide.

1.  You’re correct, however, the MRNA technology has been in the works for years and has had extensive testing and studies done to ensure safety. Not only that, but vaccines are eliminated from the body roughly 72 hours after administration. There are so many things that we put in our bodies that are not FDA approved, the FDA also approves medications that can easily kill you and questionable food additives every day so, I don’t really know how much stock I would put into that. 

2. Absolutely correct- many of those drugs were also FDA approved. Medications are much different from vaccines as you’re being continuously exposed to them over a long period of time, not twice as is the case with the vaccine. 

3. I can’t argue with this one but, I will say that covid is a fucking crapshoot. You never know how it might affect you. 

I’ll just leave you with this. There have been 200 million cases of covid worldwide- 4 million of those people have died. 2% death rate. 2 billion vaccines have been administered, less than 40 have died after receiving it.

I think it also points to a strong possibility that I have some natural peotection from tcells and memory cells that aren't tested for in the most common antibody tests.

No Covid vaccine has claimed to be 100% effective but immunization greatly reduces the risk of getting it, being hospitalized or dying from it.  The data shows this and that is still true even with the variants.

How many vaccinated people have had breakthrough infections and then died from Covid?

CDC website shows as of August 9, there have been 8,054 Hospitalized or fatal vaccine breakthrough cases reported, of those 5,928 (74%) are People aged ≥65 years and 1,587 (20%) have died.  In the overasll sceme of thing that is very small number in comparison to the population of vaccinated (\~324Million) Of course we have no way of knowing how many have been re-infected and protected because some are asymptomatic or never went to the hospital.  Hard to collect that data with take home tests too.  The CDC's focus now is on hospitalizations and deaths because that has the most impact on the medical infrastructure and the most revealing data point  What they haven't published is the breakdown of which type of vaccine these people had.

Per the CDC, To date, 619,564 people have died in the US from Covid.  

They have some great charts you can look at if you really want to see what's being reported from the states.  I recommend you familiarize yourself there before you start listening to any social media posters cause you never know who or what is real.

You might not die--but that is also what a lot of other currently young and very dead from COVID people also thought--and long COVID is unpredictable and significantly affects quality of life. I've repeated this story a few times on this sub to the chagrin of anti-vaxx trolls, but my best friend got COVID in March of last year--she is 30, healthy, no pre-existing conditions. The actual infection didn't really harm her that much, she never developed pneumonia, and her biggest issue was a recurring fever that came and went unpredictably, palpitations, and general malaise. Well, 17 months later, she's still spiking fevers, feeling exhausted, and having palpitations regularly (at least a few times a week). It has affected her quality of life and she often mentions she's terrified of just dropping dead of an undiagnosed heart defect.

h98xs6u,1629172236.0,ChrisC1234,"I totally understand your reasons (and generally agree with them).  But here are some additional things to think about:

>1) there's no long term safety studies, the vaccine itself is under emergency use authorization, which means that it's not FDA approved (because it need long term safety studies) but is authorized to be used during a pandemic.

You're right.  Some of this is bureaucracy, but there is truth that we truly don't know if there are any long term effects.  But the reality is that there hasn't been the time.  In my home state right now (Louisiana), our hospitals are FULL with COVID patients.  80% to 90% of them are people who have not been vaccinated.  That alone is enough proof that the vaccines do work.  And our news is being filled with stories [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronaviruslouisiana/comments/p5dom7/aimee_matzen_one_of_the_patients_interviewed_from/).  This poor woman was interviewed while in the hospital last month, wishing that she had just gone ahead and gotten the vaccine.  She died yesterday.

>2) Ive studied many cases of big pharma having drugs initially approved and then finding out years later, those drugs being harmful and eventually being banned. This gives me cause for concern - they aren't infallible. They have made drugs in the past that seemed very good, and turned out to be harmful.

Again, you're right, and I totally understand.  However, right now, the situation is a little different.  Again, there's not the time factor.  People are dying every day.  But also, EVERYONE is looking at these vaccines.  They needed to get them out ASAP, but something like this isn't so easily swept under the rug.  For shady stuff to get swept under the rug, there are a lot of people that need to keep their mouths shut.  Had there been anything shady going on, someone likely would have spoken up.  Anyone working on the vaccines should be able to see how serious the situation.  And at the same time, this isn't just a random drug that SOME people would take.  This is a vaccine that is ultimately for everyone.  Every person who was working on it has likely had it, their families have likely had it, their friends have had it.  The stakes for each person working on the vaccine were MUCH higher.  Also, IF there is some unforeseen side effect, you can bet that all of the brains behind creating the vaccine would be doing everything they can to treat the side effect.  (And if there is some problem where everyone just drops dead 5 years after the vaccine, then we're in for even bigger problems than your own because the majority of medical professionals and people who work on these types of things have taken it.)

>3) I'm 30 years old, extremely atheltic (I am actually an athlete who trains daily), from the studies my chances of dying from covid are around 0.001% I believe?
Aside from that the latest data shows that vaccinated people still get covid and transmit it. It seems the argument for vaccination has shifted to, get it to lessen your symptoms.

I work at a medical school.  All of the doctors that I know are saying that its' now not just the older people with pre-existing conditions that are in the hospital now.  There are younger people (younger than 30) who are getting sick and ending up in the hospital (with some dying).  This Delta variant is much worse than the initial strain.  Even our children's hospitals are full.  But again, while some vaccinated people are getting sick, it's not everyone.  And when you lessen your chances of getting it, you lessen your chances of spreading it.  That's the biggest reason I got the vaccine (and the reason I wear a mask).  I don't want to be the one to give it to someone else.  Could be your parents, a friend, or a random person at a store.  I don't want to be the cause of someone else getting gravely ill.

> 4) I had covid last year, I still test positive for anti bodies. I haven't caught it since and I wrestle daily with dozens of different people. I literally must have rolled around and grappled with over a thousand different people this past year.
I've looked at the studies and there's no evidence that vaccinated immunity is better than natural immunity through infection.
So did my dad... and he just got COVID again.  And he never got the vaccine because of some of the reasons you mentioned (in addition to some other crazier reasons).  

I know of some people that got very sick with covid.  Their thoughts on taking the vaccine has been ""I was miserable and couldn't breathe.  I want to do anything I can to prevent myself from getting that sick again, and want to make sure nobody else ever has to feel like that either.""  

So ultimately, part of the reason to take the vaccine is for your own personal safety. But another reason is to help society as a whole.  The more people who get vaccinated and lessen the easy spread of the virus, the sooner we can get back to ""normal"".",p5u9gg,p5u9gg,Hodella99,1

There are some studies that show being vaccinated can increase your antibody levels, but there is no establiahed translation to real world outcomes such as reduced mortality(which is already incredibly low for you). Even if you ignored the lack of evidence and assumed that vaccination did in fact boost your immunity, the absolute risk reduction is so absurdly small it makes the cost benefit analysis a no brainer in favor of not taking on the risks and unknowns of the vaccine.

This is correct. There's no reason for you to get the vaccine because your chances of dying from covid are extremely low. Why risk injury from an unproven vaccine when your risk from the disease itself is so small? It doesn't make sense. Plus, you have natural antibodies if you had covid previously.

>Aside from that the latest data shows that vaccinated people still get covid and transmit it. It seems the argument for vaccination has shifted to, get it to lessen your symptoms.

I don't get why vaccinated people care so much about everyone else getting the vaxx too. I have a couple theories though. Buyer's remorse and peer pressure. 1. They feel buyers remorse about getting the shot and (many times) having unplanned side effects from it. They want everyone to get the shot to confirm to themselves that they made the right decision and not a major mistake that will hurt them in the future. 2. Peer pressure. Many people who got the shot were pressured into by family and friends, and they are doing the same to others. Again I think this is done to  reassure themselves they didn't make a bad mistake in getting the vaxx.",p5u9gg,p5u9gg,Hodella99,1

Hundreds of Swedish women have reported menstrual disorders after being vaccinated against covid-19. Both the Medical Products Agency and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are following the development, but at present cannot say whether it is a side effect or not.

It has never been more than a few days late or early, and that is highly unusual. I have never had a period start in the middle of the month and have never skipped a period. If I had some weird shit happen right after the vaccine and someone tried to tell me it was just a coincidence I would be fucking livid. I know my stupid period like I know the color of my hair or my skin. I wish I didn’t, but this is just the reality of having a uterus. I guess some people have irregular periods, and for them this wonkiness is normal and they shouldn’t be freaking out about it then.

h96vuyq,1629139659.0,LeoBites44,"I was in a very similar situation in March 2020: I had finished 9 months of cancer treatments and was exhausted. Physically beat down, only to then face the life threatening virus with no vaccine and teenaged kids, in a place where probably 30% of the community didn’t believe it was a problem and ignored all advice for preventing the spread. This is what I did, and maybe it will inspire some ideas for you or at least have you realize you are definitely not alone in your feelings of concern— my family members stayed out of group situations. The kids socialized with a very limited number of individuals whose families also took the threat seriously so we had better odds of staying well. We stayed out of stores and restaurants and ordered online and picked up. We wore masks, used germ killer, wiped down groceries and washed clothes we wore to necessary doctors appointments. I researched ways to keep my body, particularly my immune system, strong and as healthy as possible so if I got covid, I had a chance to fight it. I lurked around nurses/doctor/science subs to see what scientific/medical communities were doing to prepare their bodies, like vitamin D,C and zinc supplements. My husband got covid in August despite all this. I didn’t get it. So don’t feel that you will inevitably get it if someone in your house gets it.

h99czbo,1629182009.0,theoneabouthebach,"In a somewhat similar boat and this sucks. My husband takes organ transplant meds. He had both his vaccines but we’re not sure how he did. I have spent the last few years not in great health. I seem to have some mild-moderate cfs/me and some autoimmune issues. We had toxic mold in our furnace and it really messed me up. I spent the last year crawling out of a health hole, and then covid came. I was terrified of covid, but also of the vaccines because I have a history of rare side effects to things. I also had some peripheral nerve problems in college, and I have a bit of medical ptsd from that, and reading about the weird nerve problems people were having from the vaccine really scared me. When covid hit I’d been working very hard on my health, in and out of the doctor trying to figure out what was wrong with me, and was finally seeing some progress feeling well enough to go for walks a few times a week and spend some time outside, and backsliding scared me. And also at that time it seemed like we could mostly hide from covid. Cases in my community weren’t super high, everyone was wearing masks, and we homeschooled my son. I didn’t feel well enough to go to parties and whatnot, so staying at home and hiding from covid, going for walks etc, just seemed like an easy thing to do. 

Then the mask mandate ended, and delta came right after that. Cases in my community are higher than they’ve ever been, and I really feel like I’ve painted myself into a corner by not getting vaccinated…which of course now effects my son. We can’t go anywhere now, because no one is wearing masks and my husband and I both feel uncomfortable. My son has always been able to play outside with the neighbor kids, and they’ve swam together etc all summer. But now that school is starting without masks, I don’t feel like it’s safe for him to play with them while community spread is so high. I feel like the worst parent ever for not getting vaccinated when cases were low. We could be somewhat protected now if I had. My husband is eligible for a 3rd shot. So I guess we will both go get one together, and then quarantine for a couple months while we build up some immunity. I don’t even feel comfortable going into a pharmacy right now though, because with no one masking it doesn’t seem safe to sit in there with sick people in and out. Anyways, I’m sorry this is no help to you, but I can commiserate. If it were just my husband and I this would be so much easier. But I hate that this has effected my son, and that my choices and poor health is going to isolate him for the next couple months while I get things sorted out. I just hope cases go down soon :( 

And yes, we’re for sure homeschooling again. I have a handful of friends who are homeschooling this year for the first time, because they’re not comfortable with the way covid is being approached in their schools. They don’t have the health issues and are all fully vaccinated, and are still taking this precaution…so I think it’s totally understandable that with your pre-existing condition you’d want to homeschool another year as well. The social aspect sucks for the kids of course, but the health of their father is much more important. I lost a friend to lupus last year, and watched what her little daughter went though with her mother in and out of the icu and then finally passing…doing homeschool with loving parents watching over you isn’t so bad.",p5dvqc,p5dvqc,isthishowthingsare,1

It was pretty loud in one ear for quite a few weeks and slowly got better over time. It did not get worse after the second Pfizer, which I got 12 weeks after the first. I ended up getting a bad cold right after that shot as well (not covid) and while I had a lot of congestion I didn’t have painful sinuses and that didn’t make it worse either. It has now faded to pretty unnoticeable levels. I can only hear it faintly at night and sometimes it doesn’t seem to be there at all. At its worst there were 3 different sounds happening. I understand your hesitation. I did have Covid in early 2020. I think that’s why my first shot was bad. But I can’t say for sure it caused the tinnitus if ykwim.

She was objectively tested for the allergy through a skin test at an Allergist's office and had an extreme reaction. Nurses in the practice all came in to see the reaction because it was rare. Prior to being tested at the Allergist's office she was gaslit by a dentist who refused to believe her throat was closing in response to skin-applied benzocaine.

I'm having joint pain all over, and my right nut in my ballsack also has this throbbing ache sometimes... everything comes and goes... I've been like this for about 3 weeks now.

ER said my EKG checked out fine, and my heart enzyme was 0 which is good... bloodwork was also done they took 9 vials iirc and that also came back perfect. So idk what's happening to me but it fucking sucks and I hope it goes away soon.

I can’t stand it when people think my fears over the vaccine are political. I have been afraid of medicine since I was 15 and knew nothing about politics. Now, of course I’m not saying that all side effects are panic attacks, but as I read through so many, they sound very similar and let’s face it, hypochondriacs are always looking for worst case scenarios. And like every other medication I’ve researched, it’s always people with negative experiences on the internet. Rarely do people with positive experiences speak up, because they just go on living their lives.

On a side note, if someone is having a terrible reaction, I would never brush it off and I feel like their voices should be heard, but looking for negative experiences is just a bad idea for someone with anxiety.

Lots of high fiber foods, kimchi/sauerkraut if you can handle em lol, berries are great antioxidant/anti-inflammatory... Google ""anti-inflammatory foods"" as well as ""prebiotic foods"" and again, can't stress high fiber enough :) it helps feed your good bacteria, slows things down enough for nutrients to absorb via the small intestine, cleans out the old gunk...

h96pzos,1629137305.0,3Winks,"Having highs that you describe as euphoric and then depressive  lows that leave you crying are symptoms of bipolar disorder. You say this is not normal behavior for you but could be you didn’t  recognize early signs. Think about getting an assessment- can only help. You also HAD Covid- have you thought it could be the result of the virus? I’ve had the vaccine & most of my family and friends - I know of one person who had side effects beyond a sore arm or mild flu-type symptoms last more than a day. The person was my brother,  he had severe flu symptoms for four days, but he can be a lazy little bastard and enjoyed missing work and his wife waiting on him, so who knows?
The entire pandemic has been incredibly stressful for most. Add the constant barrage of horrible things in the news right now- wild fires, mass shootings, our dangerously warming planet, Afghans being slaughtered- and it’s not surprising that it’s taking a mental toll on people. Seeing so many humans suffering and daily news stories about record setting temps leading to unsustainable life can make you feel hopeless and helpless. Depression, anxiety, mood swings are the result-  not a Covid vaccine. The worst thing you can do is subject yourself to all the negativity in posts and read random people’s theories (who may have an agenda and unlikely to be scientists or physicians educated about vaccines) that vaccines are dangerous and why- it’s only going to increase your anxiety. Can also cause you to be hyper aware of every little thing going on with your body or mood, which creates a cycle of worry and  increased anxiety. Focus on taking good care of yourself- get enough sleep, eat  well, and exercising (seeking mental health counseling is a good thing) and possibly helping humanity in some way can help for many reasons with the best seeing that there are amazingly good people in this world but sometimes you have to look.

h95l79g,1629120864.0,patrickthemiddleman,"After 12 days from the second Pfizer jab, I also still experienced heart palpitations more than usual, and a fast resting heart rate. That evening my heart rate was 108 while at rest, even though my fitness is good otherwise.

I have in fact been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder in the past, so I am also prone to anxiety, even though it has been a lot better since I started working out regularly. At that time I had just eaten a big meal and was reading about the Pfizer vaccine's potential to cause myocarditis in otherwise healthy adults at the time.

I then decided to call the local Healthcare advice hotline. The nurse took me seriously and explained that the resting heart rate and palpitations are most likely effects of the vaccine eliciting a normal immune response which the body has when it detects a virus (*or in this case the protein, which identifies the coronavirus, produced by our own muscle cells that received the mRNA, which degrades over time after being introduced into the cells, from the injection*).

She also told me that the first jab usually didn't elicit a notable immune response with generally healthy individuals that hadn't contracted the coronavirus before, and it was more like a primer for the second jab, which is much more potent and does the major part of training the immune system to protect the body from the virus.

She asked me to give it some more time, focus on resting and avoid intense workouts, while low-intensity activities are allowed and even recommended.

After the phone call, I measured my resting heart rate again and now it was **78** (lol). So definitely the palpitations and increased resting heart rate have been at least partly caused by underlying anxiety.

Now it has been 14 days since I got the second vaccine dose and I still don't feel 100%. I am still experiencing an odd feeling of pressure of sorts in my respiratory tract and have mild unusual feelings in my chest that I don't remember experiencing before in my life. I can confidently say that these feelings do not originate from anxiety, and they also get noticeably worse for a minute or so right after lifting heavy weights in the gym.

Otherwise, I don't feel sick per se, and I'm quite sure that I haven't had any fever, although I do not possess a thermometer so I could verify this.

If you received a COVID-19 vaccination:

A COVID-19 vaccination may also cause a positive antibody test result for some but not all antibody tests. You should not interpret the results of your SARS-CoV-2 antibody test as an indication of a specific level of immunity or protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

h91pimm,1629045053.0,catboysaulgoodman,I see people saying they are going to doctors with >300 antibodies after several months with the doctors saying they had “a robust immune response.” And if you don’t have antibodies from being immunocompromised you qualify for a booster.

h91x4q7,1629048199.0,amoebaD,"Israel data showed April vaccine recipients still had 75% protection against Delta in the second half of July. That’s about the gap between your vaccine and today (going off second shot I presume). Unfortunately, Pfizer efficacy against Delta infection dropped for recipients in March, February, January etc. But it still protected strongly against severe disease and death in all groups (regardless pf age). And while the effects of waning immunity were seen in all age groups, they were more pronounced in the elderly.

Another study in Singapore showed that Pfizer breakthroughs in hospital fared much better than unvaccinated. While viral loads initially remained close between the two groups, after six days Pfizer patients significantly dropped, while unvaccinated remained steady. 

Here’s my laymen interpretation: antibodies from Pfizer start and continue dropping after about 4 months (I believe another study has also found this independently). This may have some role in waning efficacy, specifically against Delta. My understanding is that antibodies are a great first line of defense, but not the only one. Delta has been characterized as “fast” relative to previous variants. I suspect the with lower antibodies, Delta can quickly cause breakthrough infections. BUT, antibodies are just the first, not the *only* line of defense. Your B and T cell response (as primed by your vaccine), will kick in and help you fight it off fast.

That’s if you get it at all. If Israel’s data is correct, you have more protection vs. Delta *infection* right now than J&J clinical trials found against the pre-Delta strain and variants. And Israel’s study is the most “pessimistic” about vaccine efficacy so far. Also, you still have SOME antibodies, which is better than nothing. Some people have none, but still have significant protection from other immune cells. 

I get the desire not to catch Covid at all! I’m in the same boat, trust me. I’m concerned about long-Covid. I know long-term problems can arise from Covid cases of any severity (including asymptomatic), but they are much rarer (and much less severe) after a mild case. The worst sufferers of long Covid are people who’ve survived a trip to the hospital or ICU. This all helps abate some of my worry (as a February Pfizer recipient) if not squash it entirely.

Also, what kind of work is this? Is it public facing? How are the case levels in your area currently? This is all info I use in my personal risk calculations. 

Hopefully some of this information is helpful to you. At the end of the day only you can determine your personal risk profile. Wear a good respirator mask, and that mitigates a lot of risk too. Good luck!",p4u2do,p4u2do,catboysaulgoodman,1

For each of these this regimen seems to help:

- Famotidine (Pepsid) - 40mg initially, then 20mg morning + 20mg evening for next 2 days


Pepsid is an over the counter medicine in many places, and is beneficial during covid19 treatment (reduces symptoms within 1-2 days), for long haulers, and post-vax most effective.

Famotidine came to light from early chinese data that showed those on Famotidine (as antacid) had a 50pct mortality rate vs those taking Omeprazole (another antacid).

Famotidine is an H2 blocker anti-histamine, that is helpful against Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), that is implicated in covid19, long haulers and possibly post-vax as well.

h8zvi8o,1629002520.0,ClockworkAeroplane,"My second Moderna shot was on the 4th. My symptoms were overall less miserable than the first time. The first time, I had a headache that nothing seemed to touch for 4 days. The second time I had a pretty high fever (for me—38.2°C—I typically run cool), but after sleeping and lounging around all day the next day, I felt pretty good. I needed a nap after breakfast the day after that, but since then I've been fine.

I haven't had the brain fog I experienced the first time (which really scared me, honestly—I'm a university professor with a bunch of research projects that need to get done this summer, and I started to worry that I might be permanently damaged the first time), but I *did* feel really depressed that day after. Like, so much that I knew that it had to be the vaccine, because there was nothing to set it off. I became so nostalgic for my teens and 20s in the 90s that I wanted to cry. I found a YouTube playlist that recreates early-to-mid-90s MTV (complete with commercials) and I ran it from my iPad next to the bed and it really helped, bizarrely. I just really missed my friends, and my girlfriend from that time (we're actually still friends, but live on opposite sides of the planet, so I never see her), and hours spent on couches in basements talking and joking and flirting and eating garbage from 7-11 and snuck beers while the video of Green Day's ""Basket Case"" played.

I don't know why it hit me so hard, and with such a specific set of memories, but it passed just like the fever.

I do think that these vaccines impact a lot of systems. I personally suspect that the spike proteins, which are not supposed to get into the blood stream, get into the blood stream, and cause mischief with all sorts of cells that have ACE2 receptors.

My wife had diarrhea so bad that I almost called the ambulance after the first shot. My mom actually had COVID last October, and she, too, struggled mostly with diarrhea that just wouldn't stop and she couldn't keep herself hydrated or nourished (both my folks are all better now, though, and are also double-vaxxed).

Anyway, point of the story: I think a lot of people experience mood changes with this stuff. 

Also, it's been a very depressing, traumatic time.

It is almost impossible to faint because of a panic attack. People have been known to pass out due to phobias such as blood, but to actually pass out due to anxiety is incredibly rare. This is because during a panic attack, your blood pressure heightens. Typically when one passes out, the blood pressure has dropped. The dizziness associated with panic attacks is usually due to the abnormal breathing, and not an indication of potential syncope.

h917x5p,1629037426.0,frequ3ncy,"I'm so sorry about your daughter. As someone with experience of panic (panic disorder for over 5 years, better now) I just want to share that a sudden onset of something scary to the mind/body like fainting from the vaccine could cause an anxious/panic loop. Her fainting from the vaccine may have been just a single episode, but now her body and mind are terrified it is going to happen again.  So a fear/anxiety loop happens which triggers a panic attack whenever she starts to feel weird or off. 

Initial scary event(fainting)-->fear response/panic-->feel weird at the movie theater-->fear that the initial scary event will happen again-->panic attack-->next time I feel weird in public-->panic attack-->etc... The panic cycle sets in.

I don't know if this is the case or not, but thought I'd share just in case it helps. Panic attacks suck. Getting out of that panic loop is a process but it is possible. If it is an anxiety response, therapy is a must to help her break the cycle. CBT, breathing exercises, mindfulness are all very helpful for breaking the cycle.

h9141bd,1629035527.0,mkdr,"All those symptoms could come from a very simple but also harmless cause: breathing too quickly / wrong. Happens more often in young adults, also under stress situations or when doing exercises and sports.

The cause of this could be stress, or other reasons, however, if you breath too quickly, whatever reason for, you breath out too much CO2, your PH level in your blood will rise and will cause all the symptoms your daughter had but also: dizziness, vertigo, tingling in arms/legs/fingers, panic attacks (which ironically will make things worse, because you breath even more quickly), headaches, rapid heartbeat, a feeling of anxieties, shacking, cold sweat, narrow feeling in the chest, tinnitus and in the worst case fainting.

Especially if you have a panic attack, you breath even more quickly which then could easily lead to fainting because PH levels go above a critical value. It is also a sort of vicious circle because above a certain PH level, even with oxygen saturation of 100% your cells cant get any oxygen anymore out from the blood. Accelerating everything even more, and you faint. Then your breathing will slow down though because it is controlled by the brain, and your PH levels normalize again after some time.

I could link a yt video which will describe everything about it, sadly it is just in German and wont be any help for you mostly, maybe for others though who can understand German: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W9bTCyUotA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOkQWAG58hU)

It is called ""Hyperventilation Syndrome"", can be acute or chronic.

[http://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/hyperventilation-syndrome-a-diagnosis-usually-unrecognized](http://www.heraldopenaccess.us/openaccess/hyperventilation-syndrome-a-diagnosis-usually-unrecognized)

Breathing exercises can help with it, you have to ""learn"" or try to breath slowly. This sounds a bit weird to most people, that you maybe read always or heard about you need to ""breath more"" to get more oxygen. However, the opposite is mostly true. Oxygen for normal people is not the issue, and youre mostly at blood oxygen saturation between 92-100% with normal and healthy lungs. However, the CO2 level is way more important, and CO2 levels are what really controls the PH level in your blood, not oxygen.

Stress of any kind, even unconsciously can lead to breathing too quickly.

If your daughter gets another panic attack, of feels dizziness, she should try to breath slowly, and calm. Also in a panic attack, breathing into a bag for a minute can help, breathing in CO2 and normalize the PH levels again quickly.

Obviously I am not a doctor, and you should speak to a doctor about this, but these are just hints which could help. You can ask your doctor about hyperventilation syndrome though and go to a doctor, which has a test meter for CO2 levels you can do or at home too easily over some time.",p4g8af,p4g8af,namebrnd_licorice,1

I think that's why they give kids those [VR headsets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBL0K2EX-o8) sometimes. Another thing that scared me was the content of certain vaccines, like mercury in tetanus. I did the math with the nurse (they ALWAYS have 5 minutes of spare time for an anxious patient) and we learned that the dose in the syringe was less mercury than a week of my regular diet.

There is risk with literally everything we do. Your risk of getting covid and having complications from that is much higher than with the vaccine. I got my first shot a week ago today and aside from having a sore arm and feeling achy the next day, I’ve been fine.",p48d3s,p48d3s,,1
h8zwvxl,1629003401.0,ClockworkAeroplane,"> There is risk with literally everything we do.

The vaccine hesitant often use this as a justification for not getting the shot, but it works better as a you have used it: A justification *for* getting the shot. 

Is there a risk of complications from the vaccine? Yes!

But that risk is *infinitesimally smaller* than the risk of complications of COVID—and that's even allowing the truth that the overwhelming majority of people who get COVID get over it fine. 

I just keep telling the vaccine hesitant:

Look, you have two choices: Get the experimental virus that came from a lab, or get the experimental vaccine that came from a lab. We don't have longitudinal data on *either,* but the data we *do* have makes it very clear that *the vaccine is safer* and it makes the virus safer *when* you get it. Unfortunately, there is no ""no experimental things from labs"" option. You're going to get COVID. Why not let your immune system learn how to beat it in the tutorial?

So much of the media's messaging with this thing has been unhelpful. They overplayed the danger of the virus to younger, healthier people, then overplayed the efficacy of the vaccines. Now they are overplaying the likelihood of you getting really sick from COVID after getting the vaccine, and it's no wonder that a lot of people are saying, ""I think I'll pass.""

The key is to acknowledge people's fears, tell them that they *are not crazy,* but that the *situation is.* Get the vax because it will help you beat the virus when you get it. Life is full of risks. Reduce yours.",p48d3s,h8xbflz,merdie801,2

I looked into it, because I, too, was really worried about that with my first shot, and I had some chest pains after the first one. They were in the wrong spot, were not sustained, and I realized they were muscle spasms, which I had a lot of after the first shot.

Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.**

I've thought about the animal reservoir too, when the pandemic started and dogs and cats were coming back positive. But I don't believe the virus acts the same in them. Like I'm not completely sure their bodies release particles like we do and if they did you'd have to come into close contact with that dog. 

What's more the bubonic plague has an animal reservoir and that's not really a problem, 

the problem is human to human transmission. 

I'd also like to point out that respiratory diseases generally tend to be endemic, like they come in seasons. I've never gotten the flu or cold in July , I've also never got RSV in the summer either I've always gotten them in the late autumn/ winter. 

Covid seems at this time to constantly be in season aka pandemic so its clearly not acting like either of those diseases. Also covid is better described as Sars like, not like flu, cold or rsv. 

He started talking about mumps outbreak which I'm unfamiliar with then does a classic pointing out the hole in his own argument to make his next statement sound more compelling. Which was the people vaccinated decades prior infected the unvaccinated which is false. 

They clearly caught mumps from someone else who wasn't vaccinated for mumps. That's where I stopped listening because that's a stretch and I can see why someone would believe him he sounds like he knows what he's talking about he's confident.

I got the J&J. A few hours later I had some issues with my gait because I was really lightheaded so I went to bed early hoping to ""sleep it off"". The next day was a lot different, I felt fine in the morning and logged onto to work, however my condition started to rapidly deteriorate over the day. I ended up in the emergency room 24 hrs post shot because I couldn't breathe. I had a low grade fever, migraines, shortness of breath, chest pain, shooting pains through all my limbs, my right hand went numb, extreme exhaustion - I couldn't make it across my living room without gasping for air, extreme back pain, like the worst I'd ever felt, my heart was nearing 130 resting as well. I ended up at the hospital for xrays and blood work for possible clots (that would have been unrelated at the time) and everything came back normal except for lung inflammation. I was given an inhaler spacer and a steroid to resolve it. There was some speculation that I may have have asymptomatic Covid at some point in the last year because apparently the reaction to the vaccine can be more severe/immediate if you've already had Covid before and have antibodies already.  
  
I felt much better using the spacer to breathe the majority of other symptoms subsided in a day or so. However, I was still having random shocking pains in my head and violent shocking pains in my thighs and calves that persisted for at least two weeks as well as the shortness of breath. I have asthma and it was well managed, however I needed to use the spacer with 6 puffs 4 times a day to breathe correctly, that's in conjunction with Advair and Singulair, something I've never had to do in my life. I returned to my primary care physician who advised me to report the entire situation to VAERS which I did a few days later. Blood work for clots was ordered again due to the ongoing leg pain and it came back clear. The stabbing pain in my calves and thighs was still persisting so I had an ultrasound which was also clear. The same day I was at my primary I also got an X-ray... this is where things get weird. I was x-rayed in the hospital the day after the vaccine and it was clear, I now have an apparent opacity in the right lower lobe of my lung that has developed between 24hrs after getting the vaccine and two weeks later. I was given a z-pak in case it was pneumonia, however while it seemed to help for a few days, I'm back to having breathing difficulty, it's 3 weeks later now. I also still have the shooting pains in my legs, however they're very sporadic vs how they were regularly happening pretty constantly prior.

When it was being injected, I felt a burning sensation. A couple of minutes later. I felt a weird minor pain near my clavicle. And pain in my temple. Very tired. 

I was doing fine for several hours and decided to cook for the family around 5:30pm. I didn’t do that much - and am now completely exhausted, started having pain in my shoulder and a pain in my thigh that feels like a huge knot. I’ve also had some palpitations. (Going to rest.) 

So far it’s still better than expected and I’m hoping it doesn’t get any worse. I’m thankful I didn’t  have anaphylaxis, but still worry about blood clots or other severe reactions.

update: 10:10pm. Haven’t had palpitations for several hours. Don’t have pain either. Just very tired at this point. No fever! Have been able
to eat just fine. Remaining hopeful 🙏🏻

10:30am (about 21 hours after shot): I haven’t had such deep sleep in a very long time. I didn’t want to get out of bed, but did at 10 so i could eat and have coffee and see if that gets me going. I’m groggy/almost feel hungover. And my head and arm are hurting again, but so far not too bad. 

12pm (23 hours post vax): headache is worse, feeling lightheaded just from walking/movement. walking from one room to the other caused me shortness of breath, so i’m just sitting down and trying to drink water. I know I may be a little dehydrated since I drank coffee this morning and not enough water so that might be part of it too. also sneezing and wondering if i’m getting a cold. 

10:15am (almost two full days after): So, fatigue was pretty bad yesterday. Last night, around 11pm, my arms started to feel like they were on fire, then my face was flushed and i had a few hives on my face. I wasn’t sure if it was a reaction to what i had for dinner or if i was getting a fever. My temp remained normal and i went to bed and woke up today feeling fine, thankfully.  Now, i just have a small red circle (about size of a quarter) where injection was. If i touch it, it hurts a LOT and feels like a little knot. 

Day 3: still have headache (temple area mostly) and redness on arm is bigger. If i touch, it it hurts. Very mild fatigue (better than it was prior two days).

“Your analysis of the situation is spot-on. This what I and some of my fellow academics have been saying as well.

They’re continuing to push for rules that *would in theory work if the vaccines halted transmission.* There’s still debate over whether the shots can slow down transmission at all; but what seems clear enough is that you aren’t going to achieve anything close to zero spread even in an environment of 100% vaxxed persons. Another error people seem to be making is assuming that vaccines will lead to a cessation in new mutations. But if vaxxed folks can still pass COVID to each other, this is just false...the virus will continue to mutate as long as it spreads. Anyway these two errors in thinking have led to this desire to implement mandates and requirements, under the false belief that this will cause a dramatic reduction in cases that will facilitate a “return to normal.” Pharmaceutical-industry studies have done such a thorough job of downplaying natural immunity (which some better studies, notably the Cleveland Clinic one, have shown can protect just as well against reinfection as vaccination can protect against a first infection) that even some educated people in my own field now think that natural immunity is a hoax, that it doesn’t prevent against future infections, that vaccination to herd immunity is the only way out of pandemic, etc. My coworkers and I are essentially taking bets on how long in-person university classes will last after we go back to teaching next month. I think that many folks are so mislead (or just in denial) about the latest science right now that it will take another disaster spike, similar to what we saw last year, before they come to their senses and realize that we can’t reach herd immunity with vaccines alone. 

For reference I am a PhD student who builds evolutionary biology models (so I don’t want this comment deleted because y’all think I’m “anti-science” or some shit) and I’ve already had COVID twice (once horribly symptomatic, then an extremely mild reinfection 15 months later). I’m mostly immune but worried about losing access to basic things like grocery stores just because I have a disability that puts me at high risk for long-term brain damage if I get any shots whatsoever.”

Editing to add some of my other comments that appear to have been deleted:

“Thanks for your comment! A huge issue with developing coronavirus vaccines in the past (and why none have been successful before now) is just that coronaviruses mutate very rapidly. So a shot that was once 95% effective against COVID will likely weaken over time, and this is probably the main reason why we are seeing so many breakthrough infections. Even if you put your best minds to the task, COVID is still gonna mutate. :( I doubt that we will ever get a vaccine that will be 95% effective in the long run. What I imagine will happen is booster shots (with a different formulation to guard against specific variants) and some sort of antiviral drug or other treatment therapy. It will likely become similar to an annual flu shot. But development of those things will take time and so I don’t think they’re tools available to help us out of the situation we are in at the moment.

Edit: agree that lots of people this fall will likely be masking symptoms/going to work sick and this will worsen the situation.”

“I don’t know much about the thresholds they’re using in those particular tests. But I do know that throughout the pandemic there’s been this flawed theory of immunity presented in many studies. People keep saying that immune = presence of antibodies. While it’s true that anyone who has antibodies should be immune, the reverse is not true...antibodies only circulate for a couple/few months or so after infection and then die down. After that the person still has immunity, but more sophisticated tests (that involve drilling into bone marrow, for example) are required to prove it. So if an antibody test is done too long after an infection, it may come back negative...but this doesn’t mean that the person isn’t immune.”",p3rilx,p3rilx,notsostoic,1

h900an8,1629005675.0,ClockworkAeroplane,"I am also an academic, and I actually work for a med school (I am not a medical doctor, though—I teach other classes). What you said there is what the medical professors in my department have been saying since the outset—and being mostly okay with it. They are MDs and nursing educators and public health nurses (i.e., people who set public health policy at the city level, meaning they are typically well-versed in epidemiology). We needed to get our students vaxxed as soon as possible so they could continue their training in hospitals, so we've been on top of the issue in faculty meetings since the beginning.

But when I say what you've said here to my friends in the US (I'm American, but live in Japan), I'm called ""anti-vax"" and denounced so angrily that at this point I don't know if I even have any friends anymore. I am talking about two very carefully worded messages in a closed forum, not a diatribe or anti-vax memes. Just walking them through the issue, with sources.

I blame the Western media. They have grossly oversold the efficacy of the shots and grossly overstated the danger to otherwise healthy people who catch COVID. Yes, it's waaaaaaaayyyyy more dangerous than the flu, and you don't want to get it. But if you do without a vaccine, you'll probably just have a shitty week and then slowly get better. It might take weeks or months to feel really normal, which is what my 70something parents went through. They're fine now (and vaxxed). But ""long COVID"" isn't some new thing. Viruses can do that. I am on two medications, an antihistamine and a steroid, for a flu I had in 2016. I maintain hope that I'll be able to get off of those meds some day, and I have been able to step the doses down to tiny amounts, but I haven't been able to get off of them entirely. I might be stuck with these symptoms (chronic hives and esophageal spasms) for the rest of my life. —But no one talks about ""long flu.""

What has resulted from the coverage is a bunch of urban, wealthy people who think you die when you get COVID, and rural and/or poorer people who know that you don't, unless it's Bubba from the Cum 'n' Go who weighed 450 pounds and subsisted on nacho cheese and slushies. The urban/wealthy incorrectly believe that vaccines grant immunity (because NPR made it sound like that), and the rural/poor know that they don't (because Fox News likes to dunk on NPR). Urban/wealthy get the shot and think that the only reason COVID still exists is those disgusting germ bags (direct quote from a friend), but are wrong about that. Rural/poor refuse the shot because they think it's a UN plot and besides it doesn't do anything anyway—but are wrong about *that.*

h8ujkm3,1628897817.0,basicslovakguy,"Your comment is most coherent wall of text I have read so far on this subreddit, so I will take my chances and speak up here.

I warmed up to the fact that ""covid shots"" (because I refuse to call those ""a vaccines"") reduce the severity of disease if any person gets it. But the fact that people who got the shot can still get reinfected, and then potentially asymptomatically spread the virus among people is really giving me a pause. Because let's be honest - how many people stayed home with slightly running nose and very mild cough that could be admitted to seasonal allergy or ""something in the air"" ?

Am I the only one who has this feeling that there is no pressure to develop a serum that will effectively end the virus ? We are being massaged by mainstream media about how this pandemic will end once we have a huge % of population getting shots, and yet... in grand scheme of things, we will be stuck with getting frequent boosters, and wearing masks, from the looks of it. Because we cannot force 100% of population to get shots - some people simply cannot take any shot whatsoever because of their health complications.

It really feels like we are trying to just force coronavirus to weaken so much it won't create more complications than seasonal flu, instead of taking radical measures to develop a serum that will, in 95% of people with shots, force the immunity to kill the virus completely. THAT would end the pandemic, and return us to normal.

Am I afraid of Covid ? Yes, I am. But I still believe that my natural immunity will take care of it. But I will take a covid shot - once there is a one that is confirmed to kill off the coronavirus in my body for years to come - you know, like other ""vaccines"" that have been fine-tuned and tested over the course of years, and, suprisingly, don't rely on mRNA technology.",p3rilx,h8tuyrm,Throw_away11152020,2

h9k05g1,1629393292.0,montgomeryLCK,"There are a few omitted nuances in this post. Let's go through them one at a time:

>There’s still debate over whether the shots can slow down transmission at all

There is no debate over this whatsoever. Getting vaccinated severely reduces your risk of infection at all and thus, risk of transmission as well. If your odds of getting infected are decimated, then of course, your odds of transmitting the disease are massively reduced as well. People who are not infected do not spread COVID. The problem is that your are accidentally including an important conditional when comparing this data: you're comparing *breakthrough* cases of the vaccinated, which are much rarer than the infection rate of the unvaccinated, to positive COVID cases of the unvaccinated. This is a false equivalency, obviously, because people who are vaccinated are *much less likely* to spread COVID, because they are far less likely to be infected with COVID in the first place.

>what seems clear enough is that you aren’t going to achieve anything close to zero spread even in an environment of 100% vaxxed persons.

This is literally impossible, even with exceptional vaccines and exceptional vaccine adoption. Even Polio, which we have successfully ""eradicated,"" still pops up around the world from time to time. But we have eliminated 99.8% of polio cases worldwide, and obliterated its ability to hurt the world at large. That is the goal here too.

The goal is not perfection. Speaking in absolutes is quite harmful because it makes it seem like progress is meaningless unless we wipe out everything 100% right away--this is a fantasy, even in best-case scenarios. Vaccines give us an incredible tool at making quick progress at stopping this disease's growth in its tracks. Just because breakthrough cases exist does not mean vaccines don't work! The important point is that they *massively* reduce your ability to become infected by COVID-19, and therefore *massively* reduce your ability to spread it!

The actual probabilities are very, very important. No one is saying that they work 100% of the time for everybody. That would be a scientific fantasy.

>we can’t reach herd immunity with vaccines alone

The scientific consensus here is overwhelmingly in disagreement with this statement, and I would like to know *exactly* what university's scientific departments you are referring to that disagree with this statement. [Current estimates](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/herd-immunity) have the vaccination rate required for herd immunity at around 85%, although initially they were lower, due to mutation and vaccine hesitancy. Slow vaccination adoption raises the threshold for herd immunity because it allows the virus to mutate more, which potentially means more variability and less vaccine efficacy etc.

There are plenty of other nuances that I could get into here, but I think I've hit the big points enough. Please let me know if you have any questions about what I've written.",p3rilx,h8tuyrm,Throw_away11152020,2

We have already established that natural immunity has too many variables from severity of infection to strain to individual health, and for a lot of folks COVID does severe damage to their ability to fight infection off anyways because it weakens the respiratory system permanently.

While some individuals may see a high degree of protection initially, it also wanes very quickly and doesn't offer much protection against variants of concern. Some individuals develop no long term natural immunity whatsoever, so it's just not something we can depend on.

The vaccines have proven to provide a much more consistent, high protection level that doesn't do the kind of long term damage an infection can do, so they're pushing for people to take the safest route through the pandemic.

I live in Japan, where this hasn't become a political issue (nothing becomes a political issue here, which is *heavenly*—people still argue with the government, but they don't turn on *each other*), but what I am seeing among my rich, white, pajama-job American friends (I'm American) is driving me nuts, as they use vaccine status to determine who the Good People and who the Bad People are. They blame the unvaccinated for new cases, even though vaccinated people can catch it and spread it almost as well as unvaccinated people—and that is likely to only get worse as new variants arise.

The simple fact of the matter is that getting vaccinated is something you do to protect *yourself.* The fact that children can't get the vaccine (yet) actually isn't that big a deal since they weather COVID so well that oftentimes people don't realize they've been infected (Cue someone posting some horror story about a dead 7-year-old... It happens; no one is saying it doesn't; but it's insanely rare.). The ire against the unvaccinated is almost wholly misplaced. Israel vaccinated basically their entire adult population and still had outbreaks. The important point is that the vaccinated don't get very sick and they don't die.

    Vaccine hesitancy. Some people may object to getting a COVID-19 vaccine because of religious objections, fears about the possible risks or skepticism about the benefits.

The fact that both vaccinated and unvaccinated can both become Infected and infect someone else means there's more of a chance of a strain mutating from these population, and if you understand how evolution works the virus strain the evades the immune response can be created from these conditions because it could freely spread between both populations it would become more or less the more common version.

Therefore, if you have a potential super-spreader event with 100 vaccinated people, even if all were exposed, you can expect maybe about 40 to get covid - unlike 100 if all were vaccinated, and this is in the case if the patient zero was as infectious as if unvaccinated (which is less likely).

With all due respect, looking online for anecdotal experiences of rare side effects, when you tick quite a few boxes for being at risk of severe COVID doesn't sound conducive to a reasonable risk/benefit analysis.

The common side-effects from the vaccine are fever, injection site pain, and flu-like symptoms. The **rare** side-effects are **rare**. Incidence of things like blood clots needs to be put in context with the overall risk of getting those problems randomly in a year, and in the risk of getting those from COVID.

* The estimated risk of getting a vaccine-induced blood clot after getting J&J is about 3 in a million.
* The estimated risk of getting a random, non-vaccine-induced blood clot in a year is about 1300 in a million.
* The estimated risk of getting a blood clot from COVID if you're sick enough to land in the ICU is 200,000 in a million.

With the comorbidities mention, you're both at increased risk of getting a severe case of COVID according to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)

""Adults of **any age** with the following conditions can be more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Severe illness means that a person with COVID-19 may need:

* Hospitalization
* Intensive care
* A ventilator to help them breathe

""Having heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and possibly high blood pressure (hypertension) can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.""

h8quo6e,1628828324.0,WilliamSPreston-Esq,"The truth is no one fully understands what happens when you vaccinate an already immune person.  

There are studies that suggest that getting fully vaccinated may reduce their immunity: 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

""Our results demonstrate that the second dose increases both the humoral and cellular immunity in naïve individuals. On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals""

Also evidence that vaccinating someone with natural immunity alters their distribution of t cells: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.12.21260227v1.full

""SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals have a higher proportion of spike-specific T cells after vaccination than before vaccination.""

The benefit of natural immunity is that its broad and not reliant on a response to the spike protein. If vaccination is shifting that immune response and making it more spike dominant, it makes sense that it would make you more susceptible to reinfection with a variant that is demonstrating an ability to evade the spike specific immunity generated by the vaccines.",p39zme,p39zme,,1

As I'm sure you're well aware something that is drilled into us in medicine is the pillar of patient autonomy and informed consent. Saying ""I need counselling"" isn't really helping my decision making at this time. 

The fact is the vaccine doesn't really prevent transmission, its main goal is to reduce risk of serious complications of COVID. Patients therefore, if they are at risk, can take the vaccine and protect themselves. I am yet to see why my taking of it would make a significant impact.

Second, I can say that no one can decide for you and in the end it's up to you. So just try to make the best decision you can with the information at hand, whatever you decide is best for you. Whatever you decide in this way will be the best move.

Some things to consider. 

* Your antibodies will help you, and as you know, once your antibodies are gone your memory cells will be able to recreate the antibodies if re-infected and help you fight the virus. This [review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00550-x) from April published in Nature concludes that memory cell responses are robust enough in previously infected people to mitigate reinfection severity, and potentially transmission.
* As a med student entering the field, there might an expectation, or requirement, to get it, so you can wait until that moment arrives or ""get it out of the way"". 
* Looking at the research is a good idea, but you have to look at it with a critical eye. For example, most studies that compare vaccine immunity against natural immunity do so by comparing people who have received two vaccine doses against people who have recovered from a single exposure of covid. This is an unfair comparison. [Some research](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c03972) shows that natural immunity is at a minimum similar to a single dose of a vaccine, though individual variation make make it stronger than that. If anything, comparing people who had two doses of the vaccine is better against people who have recovered from Covid twice :)
* All that said, double or triple dose of a vaccine seems to be the most efficient way to reduce transmission in the first place. Although many researchers think [it's likely here to stay](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), the best chance at eradicating this is through vaccination. Even if eradication is not the goal, reducing the chance of transmission can also be important if you are around vulnerable people. That's not to say that your natural immunity is not effective, nor is it to say that you can't get sick ever after being vaccinated. 
* As effective treatments continue to develop, as the population's immunity continues to rise (through natural or vaccine means), and as variants continue to pop up, whatever is ""most"" effective might change, too.

Equally annoying are the hordes ot conspiracy-theorists with outlandish beliefs that chant “one of us” whenever you express an inkling of concern.

Ideally I’ll wait until the more a traditional vaccine like Novavax comes out. People will say “it’s your choice” but then push you into a corner. The discussions and overall climate is just so hostile, which is unfortunate.

I got my first dose of Pfizer on June 21st. I had a mild fever and have generally felt exhausted since (I did get the first dose while having a UTI and taking antibiotics so that could be a factor).

I got my second dose 14 hours ago. I started getting extreme stomach cramps around 5 hours after and was very nauseous and had diarrhea and went to bed. I woke up 2 hours ago with horrible teeth-chattering chills and a fever of 104.3 I took some extra strength Tylenol and after about an hour the fever is down to just 100.6 and I’m feeling a lot better, minus some intense body aches. 

This definitely really sucks, but I still feel like it was worth it. The worst of it so far only lasted an hour (had I taken Tylenol right away I think it could have been shorter). I just keep reminding myself that if this is how my body reacts to the vaccine, actually catching covid would probably be complete misery.

Now they’re saying that the efficiency of Pfizer is waning, and Moderna protects better against Delta. It’s exhausting to keep up.

When I say very rare side effects I mean occurring in ~6 people out of one million. 
When you take any medicines in your life, there is always a long list of possible side effects.  Many of them are much more common to occur than any side effect in any vaccine we’ve ever had.  We take some medicines for years, and side effects can pop up after years.  Not so with vaccines.

While it might be unlikely that things go wrong, if they do go wrong you have sacrificed any ability to say or do anything about it. The broader implication is that we have erased the incentive for scientific advancement and safety testing by absolving the manufacturers and providers of any liability.

Whether it's 5, 500, 50 million people who's lives are ruined by the vaccine those are individual lives that matter. There should be incentive to protect every life, not just the majority.

Shortness of breath, chest pain, reduced physical ability has little to do with anxiety. It's easy to distinguish the two.This being said, looks like the most common spread side effect of these ""vaccines"" : chest pain, heart palpitations, reducded physical ability. Nobody knows why for sure, the most widespread theory has to do with micro clottings impairing blood flow.

h8nii4f,1628775297.0,implodemode,"I think you should see your doctor if at all possible because most of us are not doctors and certainly can not diagnose or treat you.

However, I went to ER for shortness of breath myself after the vaccine, and they told me I was fine, in spite of not being able to get a deep breath. You may be one of those who are dealing with inflammation too. My doctor actually brushed off my symptoms as anxiety even though I told her repeatedly that I am NOT anxious at all. I had no qualms about getting the vaccine. However, I had inflammation issues long before covid and this was made far worse.

For me, it seems to be not so much my lungs or heart but the muscles in my torso all seized up so I could not expand my lungs fully. My doctor would not listen and did not touch me to see if my muscles were tight. I went for massage and my RMT could not believe how tight I was - it was alarming. Massage, frankly, barely helped, but it feels good so I keep going. I also visited a naturopath (my husband booked it as it's not something I'm inclined toward). But since my doctor left me on my own, I figured, what the hell. She put me on an anti-inflammatory diet - basically no sugar, no gluten, no dairy, no cruciferous veggies. It has not been a fun diet but hey - I started to improve in just a few days.  Sometimes, I still can't get that deep breath, and I still get very winded on exertion (but I had covid earlier). I haven't had a sense of smell for years because of inflammation in my sinuses - but I can smell again and breath through my nose! I had been to the specialist for that and neither he, nor my regular doctor suggested anything about diet to deal with the inflammation - just various nose sprays that didn't work deeply enough.  My doctor actually did book a breathing test for me but I guess with all the serious covid people, I couldn't get in until October. So, I guess I'll see if there is some other damage then. 

But the numbness in the arms and hands I did not have and this is something I am familiar with because I have a really bad neck and before surgery, this was typical. Because of this and the pain going into your back, I would really want that checked out. You may have to push for one of those doohickeys that monitor you for a couple days to be sure there's nothing. (My husband had issues way back when he was 32. ER doctors then did not consider heart issues at all. I finally called our gp and begged him to order a stress test for him and he listened.

h8m3og2,1628739907.0,noTSAluv,"I've worked with hospital data relating from billing to infectious diseases, etc.Different hospitals have different systems, but what makes it challenging is that some hospitals are not collecting data if a patient is vaccinated or not.

Other hospitals didn't have a set definition of what vaccinated meant. In other words, if we said, we need all covid vaccinated patients---does that mean fully vaccinated or does it include one shot? At the time the fields given only captured the fully vaccinated status. We couldn't really say, give me all vaccinated patients with moderna or pfizer that only had one dose. It was all or nothing.

Also, if a patient were to die, and hospitalized, sure we could say, find all patients who died in the hospital who had a vaccine status. Problem was, then, how can you really filter those who died b/c of the vaccine? That would required that the death was autopsied and attributed to the vaccine. And even then, that takes 3-6 months, and from the fields we saw, no way we could capture that on a query. Again, hard fact to capture as is not as simply as dying and immediately saying, it was because of the vaccine.

One hospital didn't even ask for vaccine status upon admission. This is as recent as of 3-4 weeks ago. So if things changed since then, and I highly doubt it, maybe somebody can report that data---again, chances of that happening, equally to the CDC admitting people are dying because of the shots: null. Better chances are that Santa will drop down your chimney this year.

So when I see the news that only the unvaccinated are dying or hospitalized, then i laugh because maybe people had one shot, but that could be considered unvaccinated, but really, they were vaccinated, just not fully vaccinated.

&#x200B;

In fact, the AP article that misleadingly claimed that 90+ percentage of people who were unvaccinated were dying at least had the decency to say:

&#x200B;

>The AP analyzed figures provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC itself has not estimated what percentage of hospitalizations and deaths are in fully vaccinated people, citing limitations in the data.[https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187)

Things I wish I had done: Taken a multivitamin daily for a while before my vaccine, omega 3s, and rested fully after both doses for a week. Maybe I would have done aspirin + vitaminc500mg (multiple times a day) as well for the first 3-4 days. Get enough electrolytes throughout the entire process especially magnesium, and especially if you take a PPI medicine or similar. My brother didn't have any issues despite taking the same medicine, though he probably had a slightly better diet and less nutritonal deficiencies heading in (I have dietary issues so probably had a lot of nutritional holes leading to a poor reaction from my immune system, this is why I'm suggesting multivitamin to make sure you're good).

Novavax seems to cause a weaker immune response, but you need an immune response for a vaccine to work, so they added an adjuvant to make the response stronger.

I took the vaccine at about 4:00pm on a Tuesday. Wednesday morning I felt fatigue, soreness at injection site and a killer headache. All except the soreness went away in 2 days. 

However, that Saturday I had a random shortness of breath and dizzy spell that set off the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t even take a step without feeing shortness of breath. I went to the ER and told the medical staff there about my recent vaccine. The nurses and the doctor who treated me seemed very uninterested in that. Almost as if it were laughable the two could be related.

Here I am 16 days later. I’ve woken up twice at night gasping/feeling breathless, and feeing as if my heart skipped a beat. I’ve had dizzy spells (vertigo/feels like I’m about to faint) the past few days. Headaches also started. Now, I have never suffered from headaches in my life (32 yr old male) unless it was due to a bad hangover and even then, they are very rare for me. I find myself with headaches every other day since taking the vaccine. 

I saw a cardiologist who did an EKG and took my blood pressure. I have an appointment for bloodwork and will be wearing a heart monitor for a week.

Once I woke up in the morning these became less severe but I skipped work. Rested up, took Tylenol, drank a crap ton of electrolytes and water, fell asleep on and off and by the evening I felt 80-90% normal, just a little worn out (like when you just get over a cold).

Basically expect a flu for 24 hours. But I think you’ll be able to work aside from the one day after getting the vaccine.

Edit: Oh and they certainly should be safe. I’ve been holding off because of similar fears but decided to take the leap and I’ve been fine so far. :) I think I realized that it’s also important for society to get back to normal that I be part of the vaccinated group of people; we need everyone we can so that COVID won’t spread as fast, and even if it does, that less people die and go to the hospital so that we can effectively treat it like a normal flu.

It’s actually a long ass story and I’m trying to find someone with similar issues so I can hopefully get some answers if someone else has been able to have it solved yet…

I got the J&J. A few hours later I had some issues with my gait because I was really lightheaded so I went to bed early hoping to ""sleep it off"". The next day was a lot different, I felt fine in the morning and logged onto to work, however my condition started to rapidly deteriorate over the day. I ended up in the emergency room 24 hrs post shot because I couldn't breathe. I had a low grade fever, migraines, shortness of breath, chest pain, shooting pains through all my limbs, my right hand went numb, extreme exhaustion - I couldn't make it across my living room without gasping for air, extreme back pain, like the worst I'd ever felt, my heart was nearing 130 resting as well. I ended up at the hospital for xrays and blood work for possible clots (that would have been unrelated at the time) and everything came back normal except for lung inflammation. I was given an inhaler spacer and a steroid to resolve it. There was some speculation that I may have have asymptomatic Covid at some point in the last year because apparently the reaction to the vaccine can be more severe/immediate if you've already had Covid before and have antibodies already.

I felt much better using the spacer to breathe the majority of other symptoms subsided in a day or so. However, I was still having random shocking pains in my head and violent shocking pains in my thighs and calves that persisted for at least two weeks as well as the shortness of breath. I have asthma and it was well managed, however I needed to use the spacer with 6 puffs 4 times a day to breathe correctly, that's in conjunction with Advair and Singulair, something I've never had to do in my life. I returned to my primary care physician who advised me to report the entire situation to VAERS which I did a few days later. Blood work for clots was ordered again due to the ongoing leg pain and it came back clear. The stabbing pain in my calves and thighs was still persisting so I had an ultrasound which was also clear. The same day I was at my primary I also got an X-ray... this is where things get weird. I was x-rayed in the hospital the day after the vaccine and it was clear, I now have an apparent opacity in the right lower lobe of my lung that has developed between 24hrs after getting the vaccine and two weeks later. I was given a z-pak in case it was pneumonia, however while it seemed to help for a few days, I'm back to having breathing difficulty, it's 3 weeks later now. I also still have the shooting pains in my legs, however they're very sporadic vs how they were regularly happening pretty constantly prior.",p2h3q1,p2h3q1,BoomerBarnes,1

Fact-checking is completely separate from safety testing made by manufacturers and governing bodies. Fact-checking is about balancing misinformation. The Dunning-Kruger effect makes people draw their own conclusions and post them on social media (because it's common sense, right?), and others will rather believe what people post on social media (because big pharma can not be trusted, right?).

One example is the widespread claim that Pfizer is safer than Moderna because it's given at a lower dosage. Apparently, social media posters were able to deduce this, but companies weren't able to find this out through years of research? One can either believe this is because there is a great cover-up or conspiracy, or maybe, just maybe the manufacturers considered this and found that the exact dosage didn't affect the safety and efficacy?

“In the first few days after your vaccination seek medical attention if you experience new onset chest pain, shortness of breath or an abnormal heartbeat. These are potential signs of myocarditis.

Myocarditis has affected less than one person in a million people who have had Comirnaty vaccine in the European Union countries.3 In most cases the myocarditis was mild and is not expected to have any long-term effects.

Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in protecting people from COVID-19 infection, which can also cause myocarditis

Please report any adverse event following immunisation with COVID-19 vaccine to CARM.”

People were driving around with their dead loved ones in the back of their cars looking for mortuaries that would take them. At one point we had over 50 close friends and who tested positive in one week. It was like living in an horror movie really, death on all sides. We lost several friends in their 30's healthy, non with pre-existing conditions. 

Every day the ministry of health here releases a report showing how many people are infected, in the hospital, vaccinated, dead and all that. All of this to say even at our worst Delta did not kill children or make them sicker than the previous variants had (out of the over 3000 deaths we've had there have been less than 10 children and only 5 fully vaccinated people), even though whole households were testing positive. I don't know if any of this is helpful, but statistically your two year old will be sick for a day or two and then be fine if Delta were to hit your home. But if the rest of you are all fully vaccinated you've done all you can for now to keep your family safe.",p1s9rx,p1s9rx,,1

""The reason is quite simple.

The covid vax pass greatly eases life, especially when international travel is a necessity for business or life.

THAT is why even smart science people just take the vax. Their desire or need to participate in general society outweighs any potential moral wrongness of being peer pressured to take an injection that pharma companies literally profit from, nor the vague, censored science that is being parroted by the media.

You get to be a part of society, and for many people, be they stupid or smart, that desire wins over any qualms they have over a sub 1% chance (likely) of a vaccine sideeffects/organfailure, just as they rushed to shut down the world, for a virus that ended up killing only about 0.3% of its infected.""",p1o8ux,h8i78eh,Smoothridetothe5,2

The CV-ISMB considered that the current evidence does not suggest an increased risk of these disorders following vaccination with Comirnaty. Medsafe will continue to monitor reports of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding.” https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/COVID-19/safety-report-15.asp

The latest report at the time of writing says that they’re still monitoring this potential side effect. Anecdotally, though, there seem to be a lot of similar cases, and some other things that they were monitoring have gradually been moved from “monitoring” to “monitoring communication” to “alert communication”. So it’s probably worth keeping an eye on this to see if it changes.

In the meantime, no you’re not alone. Hopefully it settles down. Probably worth reporting it just so women with even worse effects are less likely to get shouted down. Plus, you know, it’d be good for your peace of mind to have someone take you seriously and look into it, even if it all comes right in a few weeks or days (which I believe it will!).",p1kwy7,p1kwy7,,1

h8el0ff,1628600072.0,ntalwyr,"Seems like it’s a relatively common side effect to get some breakthrough bleeding due to inflammation some people get in the lining of their uterus (where there are also immune cells, like in the rest of your body). You should be fine to just wait and watch, and call your doc with any additional concerns.",p1kwy7,p1kwy7,,1
